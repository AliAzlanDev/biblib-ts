  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Antirrhinum majus contains aurone with excellent
              antibacterial and antifungal activities. In addition, visible
              light activates the endogenous porphyrins of Propionibacterium
              acne, which results in bacterial death. Therefore, considering
              the above-mentioned facts, the aim of the present study was to
              prepare a topical herbal gel of A. majus hydroalcoholic extract
              and to evaluate its antiacne effects with or without blue light
              combination as an activator of the porphyrins. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: Antibacterial activity of the shoot or petal extracts
              was evaluated by disc diffusion method and the minimum inhibitory
              concentration (MIC) was calculated. Various gel formulations were
              developed by the Experimental Design software. The obtained gel
              formulations were prepared and tested for pharmaceutical
              parameters including organoleptic features, pH, viscosity, drug
              content, and release studies. Finally, the antibacterial activity
              was evaluated against (P. acnes) with or without blue light.
              RESULTS: The MIC of the extracts showed to be 0.25 $\mu$g/ml.
              Evaluation of the gel formulation showed acceptable properties of
              the best formulation in comparison to a gel in the market.
              Pharmaceutical parameters were also in accordance with the
              standard parameters of the marketed gel. Furthermore, statistical
              analyses showed significant antibacterial effect for gel when
              compared to negative control. However, combination of blue light
              with gel did not show any significant difference on the observed
              antibacterial effect. CONCLUSION: Because of the statistically
              significant in vitro antiacne effects of the formulated gel,
              further clinical studies for evaluation of the healing effects of
              the prepared gel formulation on acne lesions must be performed.",

              acne vulgaris",

              Aires, Daniel J and Schweiger, Eric S",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is increasing in
              dermatology. Antibiotic resistance and the challenges of
              isotretinoin therapy have led to investigation of PDT in the
              treatment of acne vulgaris. OBJECTIVE: To review the results of
              clinical trials and case series with respect to light source,
              topical photosensitizing agent, adverse events, efficacy and skin
              type. METHODS: A non-critical review is presented of a PubMed
              search for studies examining PDT in the treatment of acne
              vulgaris. RESULTS: The authors found 21 clinical trials and case
              series of various designs. Eight studies employed a split-face
              design comparing photosensitizer to placebo, no treatment or
              another photosensitizer. Two trials used three test spots and one
              control spot per patient. Three studies utilized control subjects
              receiving no photosensitizer with or without light therapy. All
              21 studies reported a reduction in inflammatory lesions and/or a
              significant improvement in acne. The light sources utilized
              included blue light, pulsed-dye laser (PDL), intense pulsed light
              (IPL) and red light. Studies comparing the use of PDT to light
              therapy alone demonstrated greater improvement in treatment
              groups pretreated with a photosensitizer. CONCLUSION: All studies
              reported reduction in inflammatory lesions or significant
              improvement in acne. Several studies confirm a light source
              combined with photosensitizer is superior to light alone. Adverse
              reactions including photosensitivity, pustular eruptions, and
              crusting varied among photosensitizers and light sources. PDT
              appears to be a useful therapeutic option for acne patients who
              are recalcitrant to standard treatments and poor candidates for
              systemic retinoids. Further studies are still needed before a
              consensus protocol can be established. Additional investigations
              are needed to establish optimal incubation time, activating light
              source and frequency of treatment.",
