TI  - Formulation of Herbal Gel of Antirrhinum majus Extract and Evaluation of its
      Anti-Propionibacterium acne Effects.
PG  - 53

LID - 53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antirrhinum majus contains aurone with excellent antibacterial and
      antifungal activities. In addition, visible light activates the endogenous
      porphyrins of Propionibacterium acne, which results in bacterial death. Therefore,
      considering the above-mentioned facts, the aim of the present study was to prepare a
      topical herbal gel of A. majus hydroalcoholic extract and to evaluate its antiacne
      effects with or without blue light combination as an activator of the porphyrins.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial activity of the shoot or petal extracts was
      evaluated by disc diffusion method and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
      was calculated. Various gel formulations were developed by the Experimental Design
      software. The obtained gel formulations were prepared and tested for pharmaceutical
      parameters including organoleptic features, pH, viscosity, drug content, and release
      studies. Finally, the antibacterial activity was evaluated against (P. acnes) with
      or without blue light. RESULTS: The MIC of the extracts showed to be 0.25 μg/ml.
      Evaluation of the gel formulation showed acceptable properties of the best
      formulation in comparison to a gel in the market. Pharmaceutical parameters were
      also in accordance with the standard parameters of the marketed gel. Furthermore,
      statistical analyses showed significant antibacterial effect for gel when compared
      to negative control. However, combination of blue light with gel did not show any
      significant difference on the observed antibacterial effect. CONCLUSION: Because of
      the statistically significant in vitro antiacne effects of the formulated gel,
      further clinical studies for evaluation of the healing effects of the prepared gel
      formulation on acne lesions must be performed.

TI  - An extension of a multicenter, randomized, split-face clinical trial evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of chromophore gel-assisted blue light phototherapy for the
      treatment of acne.
PG  - 94-103
LID - 10.1111/ijd.13814 [doi]
AB  - A variety of laser/light-based devices have been reported to be effective for the
      treatment of acne, yet no long-term data on efficacy and safety have been published.
      A first 12-week clinical trial ("Main trial") recently demonstrated that the KLOX
      BioPhotonic System, an LED blue light device using photo-converter chromophores, can
      significantly improve moderate and severe facial acne vulgaris with an excellent
      safety profile. This Extension trial followed the Main trial, using the same
      BioPhotonic System, with the same dose and instructions for use, on patients having
      already completed treatment in the Main trial. Main objectives of this open-label
      long-term extension 12-week study were to evaluate the efficacy of the KLOX
      BioPhotonic System on the untreated hemiface during the Main trial, as well as the
      duration of response on the hemiface treated during the first 12-week Main trial.
      Despite their young age (mean age: 21.6 years) and their 12-week participation in
      the Main trial, 49 (54.4%) of the total number of patients who participated in the
      Main trial enrolled in this additional 12-week Extension trial. Baseline grading of
      acne was performed with the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale. For each
      patient, the hemiface randomly selected as a control during the Main trial received
      6 weeks of treatment (twice weekly) and was then followed up for an additional
      6 weeks. The first hemiface treated in the Main trial was consequently observed
      throughout the Extension trial, allowing for a further 12-week assessment of
      outcomes (total 24 weeks). In light of an additional 12 weeks of treatment on the
      contralateral face, the patient compliance rate was excellent, with 91.9% of the
      total number of patients receiving at least 80% of the treatments. Patients with a
      baseline IGA grade of 2 (mild) on the treated hemiface demonstrated a success rate
      of 58.3 and 66.7% at weeks 6 and 12, respectively. At these same time points,
      subjects with a baseline IGA grade of 3 (moderate) demonstrated a success rate of
      81.8 and 90.0%. Patients with a baseline IGA grade of 4 (severe) demonstrated a
      success rate of 100% at both week 6 and week 12. When evaluating the originally
      treated hemifaces from the Main trial, the rate of return to baseline at 24 weeks
      was calculated to be 15.5%. This latter outcome confirmed the long duration of
      effect following treatment. The patient safety profile was also excellent, with very
      few related adverse events. The BioPhotonic System, which is comprised of LED blue
      light phototherapy and photo-converter chromophores, provides long-term efficacy and
      safety in the treatment of acne vulgaris, with a rate of compliance above what is
      generally observed in a young population of patients suffering from acne vulgaris,
      especially in light of sequential enrollment in a study treating one hemiface.

TI  - Exposure to Visible Light Emitted from Smartphones and Tablets Increases the
      Proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus: Can this be Linked to Acne?
PG  - 163-168
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to rapid advances in modern technologies such as telecommunication
      technology, the world has witnessed an exponential growth in the use of digital
      handheld devices (e.g. smartphones and tablets). This drastic growth has resulted in
      increased global concerns about the safety of these devices. Smartphones, tablets,
      laptops, and other digital screens emit high levels of short-wavelength visible
      light (i.e. blue color region in the visible light spectrum). MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      At a dark environment, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria were exposed to the light
      emitted from common tablets/smartphones. The control samples were exposed to the
      same intensity of light generated by a conventional incandescent light bulb. The
      growth rate of bacteria was examined by measuring the optical density (OD) at 625 nm
      by using a spectrophotometer before the light exposure and after 30 to 330 minutes
      of light exposure. RESULTS: The growth rates of bacteria in both smartphone and
      tablet groups were higher than that of the control group and the maximum
      smartphone/control and tablet/control growth ratios were observed in samples exposed
      to digital screens' light for 300 min (ratios of 3.71 and 3.95, respectively).
      CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates
      the effect of exposure to light emitted from digital screens on the proliferation of
      Staphylococcus aureus and its association with acne pathogenesis. Our findings show
      that exposure to short-wavelength visible light emitted from smartphones and tablets
      can increase the proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus.

TI  - A Retrospective Study of Multiple Sequential Light and Laser Sources to Activate
      Aminolevulinic Acid in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris.
PG  - 105-111
AB  - Reports of the sequential use of multiple light and laser sources for topical
      5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) activation in photodynamic therapy (PDT) of inflammatory
      acne vulgaris are lacking. The authors sought to retrospectively compare
      field-directed ALA-PDT with blue light only, blue light + pulsed dye laser (PDL),
      blue light + intense pulsed light (IPL), blue light + PDL + IPL, or blue light + red
      light + PDL + IPL for inflammatory acne of the face or upper trunk. Results showed a
      trend toward greater patient-reported improvement with comparable tolerability using
      multiple, sequential light sources in ALA-PDT for acne vulgaris, albeit not
      statistically significant. The addition of red light, however, did not improve
      outcomes. The disparate numbers of patients between treatment arms and high
      potential for recall bias limit this single-center retrospective study.

TI  - Laser-Assisted Photodynamic Therapy: Two Novel Protocols for Enhanced Treatment
      Results.
PG  - 329-331
AB  - <p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a topical photosensitizing agent which is
      activated by a light source to cause destruction of specific cells. Commonly used
      for the treatment of actinic keratoses and photodamage, PDT can also be used for
      other conditions including acne and sebaceous hyperplasia. Here we report our
      experience with two treatment protocols. The first protocol utilizes laser assisted
      delivery of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid for enhanced efficacy of blue light
      photodynamic therapy in the treatment of actinic keratoses and photodamage. The
      second protocol utilizes red light photodynamic therapy followed by pulsed dye laser
      to effectively target sebaceous glands in patients with extensive sebaceous
      hyperplasia.</p> <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(4):329-331.</em></p>.

TI  - Light therapies for acne: abridged Cochrane systematic review including GRADE
      assessments.
PG  - 61-75
LID - 10.1111/bjd.15495 [doi]
AB  - We undertook a Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the
      effects of light-based interventions for acne vulgaris. We searched the Cochrane
      Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, ISI Web of Science and
      grey literature sources (September 2015). We used the Grading of Recommendations
      Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group approach to assess the quality
      of evidence (QoE). We included 71 RCTs (4211 participants, median sample size 31).
      Results from a single study (n = 266, low QoE) showed little or no difference in
      effectiveness on participants' assessment of improvement between 20% aminolaevulinic
      acid (ALA) photodynamic therapy (PDT), activated by blue light, vs. vehicle plus
      blue light, whereas another study (n = 180) comparing ALA-PDT (red light)
      concentrations showed that 20% ALA-PDT was no more effective than 15% ALA-PDT but
      better than 10% and 5% ALA-PDT. Pooled data from three studies (n = 360, moderate
      QoE) showed that methyl aminolaevulinate PDT, activated by red light, had a similar
      effect on changes in lesion counts vs. placebo cream with red light. Several studies
      compared yellow light with placebo or no treatment, infrared light with no
      treatment, gold microparticle suspension with vehicle and clindamycin/benzoyl
      peroxide (C/BPO) combined with pulsed dye laser with C/BPO alone. None of these
      showed any clinically significant effects. Most studies reported adverse effects,
      but inadequately, with scarring reported as absent, and blistering only in studies
      on intense pulsed light, infrared light and PDT (very low QoE). Carefully planned
      studies, using standardized outcome measures and common acne treatments as
      comparators, are needed.

AB  - Blue light irradiation (BLI) is an FDA-approved method for treating certain types of
      infections, like acne, and is becoming increasingly attractive as an antimicrobial
      strategy as the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant "superbugs" rises. However, no
      study has delineated the effectiveness of BLI throughout different bacterial growth
      phases, especially in more BLI-tolerant organisms such as Escherichia coli. While
      the vast majority of E. coli strains are nonpathogenic, several E. coli pathotypes
      exist that cause infection within and outside the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we
      compared the response of E. coli strains from five phylogenetic groups to BLI with a
      455 nm wavelength (BLI(455) ), using colony-forming unit and ATP measurement assays.
      Our results revealed that BLI(455) is not bactericidal, but can retard E. coli
      growth in a manner that is dependent on culture age and strain background. This
      observation is critical, given that bacteria on and within mammalian hosts are found
      in different phases of growth.

AB  - The treatment of acne and acne scarring with lasers and light-based and energy-based
      technologies has become an integral component of our therapeutic arsenal. Lasers
      including infrared wavelengths and pulsed dye lasers; light devices including blue
      light, red light, and broadband light; and photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic
      acid and methylaminolevulinic acid have been shown to be effective in the treatment
      of acne vulgaris. The optimal outcomes are achieved with photodynamic therapy
      combined with medical therapy. Acne scarring has been best treated with lasers,
      including nonablative infrared lasers, fractional nonablative and ablative laser
      resurfacing, and most recently needle-based radiofrequency devices.

TI  - Acne Treatment With 3-Step Broadband Light Protocol.
PG  - 1382-1388
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A new 3-step protocol using broadband light allows
      patients with moderate to severe in ammatory acne to avoid potential side effects of
      systemic acne treatments and the risks and uncertainties associated with laser and
      light treatments to date. The protocol also addresses acne scarring and, with
      appropriate modi cations, all skin types. METHODS: The protocol consists of 6 to 8
      treatments performed with a single device that allows the user to select wavelength,
      spot size, uence, and pulse duration. Step 1 uses blue light with a large spot size
      and low uence to kill Propionibacterium acnes. Step 2 features red and yellow light
      with a smaller spot size and higher uence, which together exert anti-in ammatory
      effects and trigger neocollagenesis. Step 3 employs visible and infrared (IR) light
      with a high uence and 12-second pulse length, delivered with a constant motion
      technique, to enhance previous results while also targeting areas of frequent
      breakouts. RESULTS: Challenging cases treated with the protocol include a young
      adult female with a nearly decade-long history of in ammatory and cystic acne. Her
      skin remained clear more than 6 months post-treatment. She reported her scarring
      reduction at 90%. Having treated more than 100 patients with the protocol, the
      author reports that approximately 80% of patients clear completely or achieve at
      least a 75% improvement in their in ammatory acne. Acne improvements start appearing
      2 to 3 days after a treatment session. Red, purple, raised, or depressed acne scars
      less than 1 to 2 years old begin to fade 1 to 3 weeks post-treatment. CONCLUSION:
      The 3-step protocol is safe and effective for patients with moderate to severe in
      ammatory acne and acne scarring. <em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2016;15(11):1382-1388.</em>.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a variety of laser/light-based devices have been reported to be
      effective for the treatment of acne, long-term data on efficacy and safety in the
      management of moderate and severe inflammatory acne is lacking. The objective of
      this 12-week clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the KLOX
      BioPhotonic System, a LED blue light device using specific photo-converter
      chromophores, in the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. METHODS: One
      patient hemiface was randomly selected to receive 6 weeks of treatment (twice
      weekly) with the LED light and the photo-converter chromophores whereas the
      contralateral hemiface was not treated with the BioPhotonic System. All patients
      were provided with a skin cleanser and a non-comedogenic cream with ultraviolet
      protection to be used on the entire face during the treatment period. Following
      completion of the 6-week treatment period, the patient was followed for an
      additional 6 weeks. Efficacy was assessed through changes in acne severity using the
      Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale and inflammatory acne lesion counts,
      both evaluated against baseline at weeks 6 and 12. Safety was assessed through
      physical exam, vital signs, laboratory evaluations, and physician and patient
      reporting of adverse events. RESULTS: A reduction of at least two grades in IGA
      scale severity was demonstrated in 51.7% of patients at week 12. Furthermore, at
      week 12, subjects with a baseline IGA grade of 3 (moderate) demonstrated a success
      rate (2 or greater grade drop) of 45.3% whereas patients with a baseline IGA grade
      of 4 (severe) demonstrated a success rate of 61.1%. Acne inflammatory lesion counts
      confirmed these results, with a reduction of at least 40% of lesions in 81.6% of
      treated hemifaces after 12 weeks. Treatment was considered as safe and well
      tolerated, with no serious adverse event and no patient discontinuation from the
      study from any adverse event. Patients' quality of life was also improved with a
      decrease of pain linked to acne after the 6-week treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: The
      BioPhotonic System comprised of LED blue-light phototherapy and photo-converter
      chromophores was found to be efficacious and safe, with a sustained clinical
      response at 12 weeks for the management of moderate to severe facial inflammatory
      acne.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is a very common skin problem that presents with
      blackheads, whiteheads, and inflamed spots. It frequently results in physical
      scarring and may cause psychological distress. The use of oral and topical
      treatments can be limited in some people due to ineffectiveness, inconvenience, poor
      tolerability or side-effects. Some studies have suggested promising results for
      light therapies. OBJECTIVES: To explore the effects of light treatment of different
      wavelengths for acne. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to
      September 2015: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and
      LILACS. We searched ISI Web of Science and Dissertation Abstracts International
      (from inception). We also searched five trials registers, and grey literature
      sources. We checked the reference lists of studies and reviews and consulted study
      authors and other experts in the field to identify further references to relevant
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We updated these searches in July 2016 but
      these results have not yet been incorporated into the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: We
      included RCTs of light for treatment of acne vulgaris, regardless of language or
      publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological
      procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 71 studies, randomising a
      total of 4211 participants.Most studies were small (median 31 participants) and
      included participants with mild to moderate acne of both sexes and with a mean age
      of 20 to 30 years. Light interventions differed greatly in wavelength, dose, active
      substances used in photodynamic therapy (PDT), and comparator interventions (most
      commonly no treatment, placebo, another light intervention, or various topical
      treatments). Numbers of light sessions varied from one to 112 (most commonly two to
      four). Frequency of application varied from twice daily to once monthly.Selection
      and performance bias were unclear in the majority of studies. Detection bias was
      unclear for participant-assessed outcomes and low for investigator-assessed outcomes
      in the majority of studies. Attrition and reporting bias were low in over half of
      the studies and unclear or high in the rest. Two thirds of studies were
      industry-sponsored; study authors either reported conflict of interest, or such
      information was not declared, so we judged the risk of bias as unclear.Comparisons
      of most interventions for our first primary outcome 'Participant's global assessment
      of improvement' were not possible due to the variation in the interventions and the
      way the studies' outcomes were measured. We did not combine the effect estimates but
      rated the quality of the evidence as very low for the comparison of light therapies,
      including PDT to placebo, no treatment, topical treatment or other comparators for
      this outcome. One study which included 266 participants with moderate to severe acne
      showed little or no difference in effectiveness for this outcome between 20%
      aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT (activated by blue light) versus vehicle plus blue
      light (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.04, low-quality
      evidence). A study (n = 180) of a comparison of ALA-PDT (activated by red light)
      concentrations showed 20% ALA was no more effective than 15% (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96
      to 1.15) but better than 10% ALA (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.42) and 5% ALA (RR 1.47,
      95% CI 1.19 to 1.81). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial
      outcome (NNTB) was 6 (95% CI 3 to 19) and 4 (95% CI 2 to 6) for the comparison of
      20% ALA with 10% and 5% ALA, respectively.For our second primary outcome
      'Investigator-assessed changes in lesion counts', we combined three RCTs, with 360
      participants with moderate to severe acne and found methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) PDT
      (activated by red light) was no different to placebo cream plus red light with
      regard to change in inflamed lesions (ILs) (mean difference (MD) -2.85, 95% CI -7.51
      to 1.81), percentage change in ILs (MD -10.09, 95% CI -20.25 to 0.06), change in
      non-inflamed lesions (NILs) (MD -2.01, 95% CI -7.07 to 3.05), or in percentage
      change in NILs (MD -8.09, 95% CI -21.51 to 5.32). We assessed the evidence as
      moderate quality for these outcomes meaning that there is little or no clinical
      difference between these two interventions for lesion counts.Studies comparing the
      effects of other interventions were inconsistent or had small samples and high risk
      of bias. We performed only narrative synthesis for the results of the remaining
      trials, due to great variation in many aspects of the studies, poor reporting, and
      failure to obtain necessary data. Several studies compared yellow light to placebo
      or no treatment, infrared light to no treatment, gold microparticle suspension to
      vehicle, and clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide combined with pulsed dye laser to
      clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide alone. There were also several other studies comparing
      MAL-PDT to light-only treatment, to adapalene and in combination with long-pulsed
      dye laser to long-pulsed dye laser alone. None of these showed any clinically
      significant effects.Our third primary outcome was 'Investigator-assessed severe
      adverse effects'. Most studies reported adverse effects, but not adequately with
      scarring reported as absent, and blistering reported only in studies on intense
      pulsed light, infrared light and photodynamic therapies. We rated the quality of the
      evidence as very low, meaning we were uncertain of the adverse effects of the light
      therapies.Although our primary endpoint was long-term outcomes, less than half of
      the studies performed assessments later than eight weeks after final treatment. Only
      a few studies assessed outcomes at more than three months after final treatment, and
      longer-term assessments are mostly not covered in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:
      High-quality evidence on the use of light therapies for people with acne is lacking.
      There is low certainty of the usefulness of MAL-PDT (red light) or ALA-PDT (blue
      light) as standard therapies for people with moderate to severe acne.Carefully
      planned studies, using standardised outcome measures, comparing the effectiveness of
      common acne treatments with light therapies would be welcomed, together with
      adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

AB  - Light-emitting diodes (LED) have been used to treat acne vulgaris. However, the
      efficacy of LED on sebaceous lipid production in vitro has not been examined. This
      study investigated the efficacy of 415 nm blue light and 630 nm red light on lipid
      production in human sebocytes. When applied to human primary sebocytes, 415 nm blue
      light suppressed cell proliferation. Based on a lipogenesis study using Oil Red O,
      Nile red staining, and thin-layered chromatography, 630 nm red light strongly
      downregulated lipid production in sebocytes. These results suggest that 415 nm blue
      light and 630 nm red light influence lipid production in human sebocytes and have
      beneficial effects on acne by suppressing sebum production.

AB  - The treatment of acne vulgaris poses a challenge to the dermatologist, and the
      disease causes emotional anxiety for the patient. The treatment of acne vulgaris may
      be well-suited to home-use applications, where sufferers may be too embarrassed to
      seek medical treatment. This randomized controlled study is designed to quantify the
      effectiveness of using a blue light device in a therapy combined with proprietary
      creams, in the investigation of a self-treatment regimen. A total of 41 adults with
      mild-to-moderate facial inflammatory acne were recruited. The subjects were randomly
      assigned to combination blue light therapy (n = 26) or control (n = 15). Photography
      was used for qualitative assessment of lesion counts, at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12.
      All subjects in the treatment cohort achieved a reduction in their inflammatory
      lesion counts after 12 weeks. The mean inflammatory lesion counts reduced by 50.02%
      in the treatment cohort, and increased by 2.45% in the control cohort. The reduction
      in inflammatory lesions was typically observable at week-3, and maximal between
      weeks 8 and 12. The treatment is free of pain and side-effects. The blue light
      device offers a valuable alternative to antibiotics and potentially irritating
      topical treatments. Blue light phototherapy, using a narrow-band LED light source,
      appears to be a safe and effective additional therapy for mild to moderate acne.

TI  - Recent advances in acne pathogenesis: implications for therapy.
PG  - 479-88
LID - 10.1007/s40257-014-0099-z [doi]
AB  - Acne pathogenesis is a multifactorial process that occurs at the level of the
      pilosebaceous unit. While acne was previously perceived as an infectious disease,
      recent data have clarified it as an inflammatory process in which Propionibacterium
      acnes and innate immunity play critical roles in propagating abnormal
      hyperkeratinization and inflammation. Alterations in sebum composition, and
      increased sensitivity to androgens, also play roles in the inflammatory process. A
      stepwise approach to acne management utilizes topical agents for mild to moderate
      acne (topical retinoid as mainstay ± topical antibiotics) and escalation to oral
      agents for more resistant cases (oral antibiotics or hormonal agents in conjunction
      with a topical retinoid or oral isotretinoin alone for severe acne). Concerns over
      antibiotic resistance and the safety issues associated with isotretinoin have
      prompted further research into alternative medications and devices for the treatment
      of acne. Radiofrequency, laser, and light treatments have demonstrated modest
      improvement for inflammatory acne (with blue-light photodynamic therapy being the
      only US FDA-approved treatment). However, limitations in study design and patient
      follow-up render these modalities as adjuncts rather than standalone options. This
      review will update readers on the latest advancements in our understanding of acne
      pathogenesis and treatment, with emphasis on emerging treatment options that can
      help improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Multimodal and time-lapse skin registration.
PG  - 319-26
LID - 10.1111/srt.12195 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Computational skin analysis is revolutionizing modern
      dermatology. Patterns extracted from image sequences enable algorithmic evaluation.
      Stacking multiple images to analyze pattern variation implicitly assumes that the
      images are aligned per-pixel. However, breathing and involuntary motion of the
      patient causes significant misalignment. Alignment algorithms designed for
      multimodal and time-lapse skin images can solve this problem. Sequences from
      multi-modal imaging capture unique appearance features in each modality. Time-lapse
      image sequences capture skin appearance change over time. METHODS: Multimodal skin
      images have been acquired under five different modalities: three in reflectance
      (visible, parallel-polarized, and cross-polarized) and two in fluorescence mode (UVA
      and blue light excitation). For time-lapse imagery, 39 images of acne lesions over a
      3-month period have been collected. The method detects micro-level features like
      pores, wrinkles, and other skin texture markings in the acquired images. Images are
      automatically registered to subpixel accuracy. RESULTS: The proposed registration
      approach precisely aligns multimodal and time-lapse images. Subsurface recovery from
      multimodal images has misregistration artefacts that can be eliminated using this
      approach. Registered time-lapse imaging captures the evolution of appearance of skin
      regions with time. CONCLUSION: Misalignment in skin imaging has significant impact
      on any quantitative or qualitative image evaluation. Micro-level features can be
      used to obtain highly accurate registration. Multimodal images can be organized with
      maximal overlap for successful registration. The resulting point-to-point alignment
      improves the quality of skin image analysis.

TI  - Photopneumatic technology used in combination with profusion therapy for the
      treatment of acne.
PG  - 36-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Topical and oral medications, such as retinoids, benzoyl peroxide,
      antibiotics, and isotretinoin, have been the standard of care for the treatment of
      mild-to-moderate acne for the last several decades. More recently, a number of
      pubHshed studies on optical treatments, such as ultraviolet light, visible (blue)
      light, and intense pulsed Hght systems, have also shown clinical improvement in the
      appearance of acne. Specifically, photopneumatic technology, which utilizes gentle
      pneumatic energy (vacuum) to draw the target tissue into the treatment tip and then
      deHver broadband pulsed Hght to the dermal targets, has demonstrated marked
      improvement in the appearance of acne lesions and side effects associated with acne.
      OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using a combination treatment
      of the photopneumatic system and profusion therapy using three currently marketed
      topical agents for the treatment of mild-to-moderate acne on the face and/or body,
      including neck, chest, or back. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, dinical trial
      of 41 individuals with mild-to-moderate acne was performed. Patients received up to
      four treatments at 1- to 2-week intervals with the photopneumatic system and
      profusion therapy with three separate topical agents. Study investigators and
      subjects evaluated dinical efficacy at 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits.
      RESULTS: At three months, a 69-percent reduction was noted in inflamed acne lesions
      and a 41-percent reduction in noninflamed acne lesions was noted by physician
      assessment. Additionally, at this same time point, subjects reported
      moderate-to-marked (26-75%) improvement in acne lesions. Eighty-one percent of
      subjects (22/27) were either satisfied or very satisfied with treatment outcome.
      There were no adverse events caused by malfunction of the device, and no serious
      adverse events or deaths. CONCLUSION: The results, as well as the reported patient
      satisfaction and safety, suggest that the treatment of acne with the photopneumatic
      system in combination with profusion using currently available topical acne agents
      demonstrated significant treatment results.

TI  - The clinical and histological effect of home-use, combination blue-red LED
      phototherapy for mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris in Korean patients: a double-blind,
      randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Blue and red light have been reported to have beneficial effects on
      acne. However, there has been no double-blind, randomized study of acne treatment
      for combined blue and red light-emitting diode (LED) devices, and the associated
      molecular mechanisms have rarely been investigated. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the
      efficacy, safety and histological changes of combined blue and red LED phototherapy
      for acne vulgaris. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with mild-to-moderate acne were
      randomly assigned to either a home-use irradiation group using an LED device, or a
      control group using a sham device. The treatment group was instructed to serially
      irradiate their forehead and cheeks with 420-nm blue light and 660-nm red light for
      2.5 min twice daily for 4 weeks. RESULTS: At the final visit at 12 weeks, both
      inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesions had decreased significantly, by 77%
      and 54%, respectively, in the treatment group. No significant difference was
      observed in the control group. In the treatment group, sebum output reduction,
      attenuated inflammatory cell infiltrations and a decreased size of the sebaceous
      gland were found. The immunostaining intensities for interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1α,
      matrix metalloproteinase-9, toll-like receptor-2, nuclear factor-κB, insulin-like
      growth factor-1 receptor and sterol response element binding protein (SREBP)-1 were
      reduced concomitantly. Messenger RNA expression of SREBP-1c was also decreased. No
      severe adverse reactions were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This LED phototherapy was safe
      and effective for treating not only inflammatory but also noninflammatory acne
      lesions, with good compliance. The experimental results correlated well with
      clinical results, partly elucidating the related molecular mechanisms.

AB  - Blue light, particularly in the wavelength range of 405-470 nm, has attracted
      increasing attention due to its intrinsic antimicrobial effect without the addition
      of exogenous photosensitizers. In addition, it is commonly accepted that blue light
      is much less detrimental to mammalian cells than ultraviolet irradiation, which is
      another light-based antimicrobial approach being investigated. In this review, we
      discussed the blue light sensing systems in microbial cells, antimicrobial efficacy
      of blue light, the mechanism of antimicrobial effect of blue light, the effects of
      blue light on mammalian cells, and the effects of blue light on wound healing. It
      has been reported that blue light can regulate multi-cellular behavior involving
      cell-to-cell communication via blue light receptors in bacteria, and inhibit biofilm
      formation and subsequently potentiate light inactivation. At higher radiant
      exposures, blue light exhibits a broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect against both
      Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Blue light therapy is a clinically
      accepted approach for Propionibacterium acnes infections. Clinical trials have also
      been conducted to investigate the use of blue light for Helicobacter pylori stomach
      infections and have shown promising results. Studies on blue light inactivation of
      important wound pathogenic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa have also been reported. The mechanism of blue light inactivation of P.
      acnes, H. pylori, and some oral bacteria is proved to be the photo-excitation of
      intracellular porphyrins and the subsequent production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen
      species. Although it may be the case that the mechanism of blue light inactivation
      of wound pathogens (e.g., S. aureus, P. aeruginosa) is the same as that of P. acnes,
      this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. Limited and discordant results have
      been reported regarding the effects of blue light on mammalian cells and wound
      healing. Under certain wavelengths and radiant exposures, blue light may cause cell
      dysfunction by the photo-excitation of blue light sensitizing chromophores,
      including flavins and cytochromes, within mitochondria or/and peroxisomes. Further
      studies should be performed to optimize the optical parameters (e.g., wavelength,
      radiant exposure) to ensure effective and safe blue light therapies for infectious
      disease. In addition, studies are also needed to verify the lack of development of
      microbial resistance to blue light.

TI  - Safety and Effectiveness of a New Blue Light Device for the Self-treatment of
      Mild-to-moderate Acne.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of treating acne for eight weeks
      using a new blue light device at a dose of ˜2J/cm(2)/day (representing typical
      full-face treatment) or ˜29J/cm(2)/day (representing the typical dose after
      localized spot treatment of acne). DESIGN: Prospective, single-center, open-label
      study evaluating two levels of blue light in each subject. SETTING: Subjects were
      recruited from the local community for self-treatment at home. PARTICIPANTS:
      Thirty-two subjects with mild or moderate facial acne vulgaris. MEASUREMENTS:
      Inflammatory lesion count; number, severity, and redness of flares; improvement in
      skin characteristics (overall appearance, clarity, radiance, tone, texture, and
      smoothness); tolerability; subject satisfaction. RESULTS: The blue light treatment
      was associated with significant reductions from baseline in inflammatory lesion
      count as early as Week 1 with ˜29J/cm(2)/day and Week 3 with ˜2J/cm(2)/day (P≤
      0.01). It was also associated with significant reductions in the number, severity,
      and redness of flares and with improvements in the skin's appearance, clarity,
      radiance, tone, texture, and smoothness. Overall, 53 percent of subjects considered
      the treatment much gentler than traditional acne treatments and 61 percent were
      satisfied. Three adverse events were probably related to treatment-minimal transient
      skin dryness (2) and minimal transient hyperpigmentation (1). CONCLUSION: The blue
      light treatment is effective and well tolerated, offering rapid, gentle, and
      convenient treatment of inflammatory acne. The blue light device offers a valuable
      alternative to antibiotics and potentially irritating topical treatments and can
      also be used adjunctively to complement other therapies.

PG  - 1168-71
LID - 10.1111/j.1468-3083.2012.04487.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blue light in the 400-420 nm range has been shown to reduce the levels
      of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) in the skin. P. acnes has been postulated to
      be a critical trigger for inflammatory acne. Thus, treatment with 420 nm-intense
      pulsed light should reduce inflammatory activity in acne. AIM: To evaluate the
      clinical and histological effects of 420 nm-intense pulsed light treatment on acne
      in animal model. METHOD: Inflammation acne animal model was constructed by
      intradermal injection of P. acnes of rat auricular. Levels of tumour necrosis factor
      alpha (TNF-α) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), markers of inflammation
      implicated in acne, were assessed in treated and untreated animals by
      immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULT:
      Treatment with 420 nm intense pulsed light led to marked improvement after 6
      biweekly treatments. Immunohistochemistry and PCR showed that TNF-α and MMP-2 levels
      correlated with the extent of acneiform activity and were reduced by treatment with
      420 nm light. CONCLUSION: A 420-nm intense pulsed light may exert its beneficial
      effects on inflammatory acne by reducing the levels of P. acnes and secondarily
      reducing inflammation induced by the bacteria.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Blue-light light-emitting diode (LED) therapy has become widely used
      for the treatment of inflammatory acne. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of a
      home use blue-light LED application in improving lesions and shortening their time
      to clearance. METHODS: This was an IRB approved randomized self-control study. For
      each patient (n = 30), 2 similar lesions, one of each side of the face were chosen
      for treatment with either a blue-light LED hand-held or sham device. Treatments (n =
      4) were conducted twice daily in the clinic and lesions were followed-up till
      resolution. Reduction in blemishes size and erythema and the overall improvement
      were evaluated by both the physician and the patients. Time to lesion resolution was
      recorded. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the response of lesions to
      the blue-light LED application as opposed to the placebo in terms of reduction in
      lesion size and lesion erythema as well as the improvement in the overall skin
      condition (p < 0.025). Signs of improvement were observed as early as post 2
      treatments. Time to resolution was significantly shorter for the blue-light LED
      therapy. CONCLUSION: The results support the effectiveness of using blue-light LED
      therapy on a daily basis for better improvement and faster resolution of
      inflammatory acne lesions.

TI  - Photodynamic therapy for infections: clinical applications.
PG  - 755-67
LID - 10.1002/lsm.21080 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was discovered over 100 years
      ago by its ability to kill various microorganisms when the appropriate dye and light
      were combined in the presence of oxygen. However it is only in relatively recent
      times that PDT has been studied as a treatment for various types of localized
      infections. This resurgence of interest has been partly motivated by the alarming
      increase in drug resistance amongst bacteria and other pathogens. This review will
      focus on the clinical applications of antimicrobial PDT. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The published peer-reviewed literature was reviewed between 1960 and 2011.
      RESULTS: The basics of antimicrobial PDT are discussed. Clinical applications of
      antimicrobial PDT to localized viral infections caused by herpes and papilloma
      viruses, and nonviral dermatological infections such as acne and other yeast, fungal
      and bacterial skin infections are covered. PDT has been used to treat bacterial
      infections in brain abscesses and non-healing ulcers. PDT for dental infections
      including periodontitis and endodontics has been well studied. PDT has also been
      used for cutaneous Leishmaniasis. Clinical trials of PDT and blue light alone
      therapy for gastric Helicobacter pylori infection are also covered. CONCLUSION: As
      yet clinical PDT for infections has been mainly in the field of dermatology using
      5-aminolevulanic acid and in dentistry using phenothiazinium dyes. We expect more to
      see applications of PDT to more challenging infections using advanced antimicrobial
      photosensitizers targeted to microbial cells in the years to come.

TI  - Evaluation of self-treatment of mild-to-moderate facial acne with a blue light
      treatment system.
PG  - 596-602
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of treating
      mild-to-moderate facial acne using a new, hand-held, light-emitting diode blue light
      device in conjunction with a foam cleanser containing 5% glycolic acid and 2%
      salicylic acid plus a skin rebuilding serum containing 1.25% salicylic acid, 0.5%
      niacinamide, 0.08% liposomal-based azelaic acid and superoxide dismutase. METHODS:
      Volunteers with mild-to-moderate facial inflammatory acne used the blue light device
      twice daily for eight weeks, plus the cleanser before treatments and the serum after
      each evening treatment. RESULTS: Among 33 subjects aged 25-45 years old, 28
      completed. In a 3 cm x 5 cm target area receiving a daily dose of ~29 J/cm2,
      treatment was associated with significant reductions from baseline in the
      inflammatory lesion count from week 1 onward (P≤ .01) and in the non-inflammatory
      lesion count from week 4 onward (P≤ .05). The number of flares was significantly
      reduced from baseline from week 2 onward (P≤ .05), and flare severity and flare
      redness were significantly reduced from baseline from week 4 onward (P≤ .01 and P≤
      .05, respectively). At week 8, more than 90 percent of subjects reported
      improvements in their skin's overall appearance, clarity, radiance, tone, texture
      and smoothness. In addition, 82 percent were satisfied, very satisfied, or extremely
      satisfied with the blue light treatment system and 86 percent agreed the treatment
      system was much gentler than traditional acne treatments. CONCLUSION: The blue light
      treatment system offers effective, rapid, convenient and well tolerated treatment of
      inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions. The majority of subjects consider it
      much gentler than traditional acne treatments and it facilitates effective treatment
      without the need for antibiotic exposure. The blue light treatment system and blue
      light therapy alone are attractive treatment options for acne vulgaris, both as
      alternatives to traditional acne treatments and as adjunctive treatments to
      complement existing therapies.

TI  - Treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa by photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic
      acid: preliminary results.
PG  - 381-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current standard of care for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) includes
      antibiotics (oral/topical), retinoids (oral/topical) and intralesional steroids and
      is unsatisfactory. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 20% 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)
      has been used ?off label? to treat acne vulgaris and may hold promise as a therapy
      for HS. This open-label, non-blinded study investigated the efficacy and safety of
      ALA PDT for the treatment of HS using two blue light sources and intense pulsed
      light (IPL) for photoactivation. METHODS: Twelve subjects with active HS enrolled to
      undergo ALA PDT once weekly for four weeks with follow-up visits 4, 8, and 12 or
      more weeks later. Nine subjects completed the study through the week 8 follow-up
      visit. Lesions were counted at each treatment visit at week 4, week 8 and at the
      final week. RESULTS: Mean lesion counts were 11.25 at baseline, 6.5 at 4 weeks
      (50.8% reduction), and 7.5 at 8 weeks (29.9% reduction). Mean Global Severity Scores
      were 2.2 at baseline, 1.5 at 4 weeks, and 1.8 at 8 weeks. Mean DLQI scores were 17.3
      at baseline, 13.1 at 4 weeks (27.2% improvement), 14.00 at 8 weeks (19.3%
      improvement) and 14.0 (19.3% improvement) at the final week (16-62 weeks). Three
      subjects (25%) had complete clearance and no active lesions 4 weeks after the final
      treatment. Treatments were more tolerable for subjects treated with blue light than
      with IPL. CONCLUSION: ALA PDT may be a safe and effective treatment of hidradenitis
      suppurativa.

TI  - Current state of acne treatment: highlighting lasers, photodynamic therapy, and
      chemical peels.
PG  - 2
AB  - Acne vulgaris continues to be a challenge to dermatologists and primary care
      physicians alike. The available treatments reflect the complex and multifactorial
      contributors to acne pathogenesis, with topical retinoids as first-line therapy for
      mild acne, topical retinoids in combination with anti-microbials for moderate acne,
      and isotretinoin for severe nodular acne. Unfortunately, these conventional
      therapies may not be effective against refractory acne, can lead to antibiotic
      resistance, and is associated with adverse effects. With the rise of new
      technologies and in-office procedures, light and laser therapy, photodynamic
      therapy, chemical peels, and comedo extraction are growing in popularity as
      adjunctive treatments and may offer alternatives to those who desire better
      efficacy, quicker onset of action, improved safety profile, reduced risk of
      antibiotic resistance, and non-systemic administration. Whereas adjunctive therapies
      are generally well-tolerated, the number of randomized controlled trials are few and
      limited by small sample sizes. Furthermore, results demonstrating efficacy of
      certain light therapies are mixed and studies involving photodynamic therapy and
      chemical peels have yet to standardize and optimize application, formulation, and
      exposure times. Nevertheless, adjunctive therapies, particularly blue light and
      photodynamic therapy, show promise as these treatments also target factors of acne
      pathogenesis and may potentially complement current conventional therapy.

TI  - Comparative study of the bactericidal effects of 5-aminolevulinic acid with blue and

PG  - 661-6

AB  - Propionibacterium acnes naturally produces endogenous porphyrins that are composed
      of coproporphyrin III (CPIII) and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Red light alone and
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) improve acne vulgaris clinically, but there remains a
      paucity of quantitative data that directly examine the bactericidal effects that
      result from PDT on P. acnes itself in vitro. The purpose of this study was to
      measure the difference of bactericidal effects of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT
      with red and blue light on P. acnes. P. acnes were cultured under anaerobic
      conditions and divided into two groups (ALA-treated group and control group), and
      were then illuminated with blue (415 nm) and red (635 nm) lights using a
      light-emitting diode (LED). The cultured P. acnes were killed with both blue and red
      LED light illumination. The efficacy increased with larger doses of light and a
      greater number of consecutive illuminations. We demonstrated that red light
      phototherapy was less effective for the eradication of P. acnes than blue light
      phototherapy without the addition of ALA. However, pretreatment with ALA could
      enhance markedly the efficacy of red light phototherapy.

TI  - Photodynamic therapy for acne vulgaris: a critical review from basics to clinical
      practice: part I. Acne vulgaris: when and why consider photodynamic therapy?
PG  - 183-93; quiz 193-4
LID - 10.1016/j.jaad.2009.09.056 [doi]
AB  - The first-line treatments for acne vulgaris are conventional topical and/or oral
      medications. However, many patients have contraindications, only partial response,
      significant adverse effects, or recurrence. Light-based treatments and photodynamic
      therapy (PDT) using topical precursors of porphyrins are off-label alternative
      treatments for acne vulgaris, with their own advantages and disadvantages. To date,
      there is no consensus on PDT methodology and parameters. An understanding of
      pathophysiology of acne, light-tissue interactions, and PDT mechanisms of action is
      helpful whenever PDT is considered as an alternative treatment. In general, blue
      light alone improves acne because of its antiinflammatory effects. PDT using
      5-aminolevulenic acid (ALA) or ALA derivatives induces transient antimicrobial and
      antiinflammatory effects. At high doses, red light PDT may induce inhibition or
      destruction of sebaceous glands, resulting in clinical improvement. LEARNING
      OBJECTIVES: After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to
      compare different treatments of acne, recognize when photodynamic therapy may be a
      useful off-label treatment for acne vulgaris, and identify variables that may affect
      the efficacy of photodynamic therapy.

AB  - The medical treatment of acne is generally sufficient to meet the expectations of
      acne patients. However, in a number of situations additional therapeutic approaches
      may be advisable. There are a wide variety of useful physical methods. They range
      from electromagnetic waves, usually light, to peeling and manual therapy.
      Phototherapy of acne includes not just visible light but also laser and flash lamp
      therapy. The present review provides an overview on the evidence. Visible light, in
      particular blue light, provides an effective option for treatment of inflammatory
      acne. Photodynamic therapy also is efficacious; however, it should not be used
      because of an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio. UV treatment of acne is obsolete.
      Newer studies on the use of a variety of laser systems and flash lamps have
      demonstrated in part rewarding results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many acne patients improve after exposure to sunlight and there are many
      reports about the efficacy of blue light phototherapy on acne lesions. OBJECTIVES:
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of blue light
      treatment versus topical benzoyl peroxide 5% formulation in patients with acne
      grades II and III. METHODS: Sixty volunteers with facial acne were included and
      evaluated in 5 visits: the first one for screening, another 3 held on days 7, 14 and
      28 of treatment, and the last one after 14 days of the end of treatment. Thirty of
      them were irradiated with Blue Light (8 times, twice a week) and the other thirty
      were treated with topical Benzoyl Peroxide 5% formulation, auto-applied twice a day,
      every day. We assessed the severity of acne by counting the lesions and analyzing
      the photographs. RESULTS: The improvement achieved by the blue light was the same as
      the one with benzoyl peroxide, regardless of the type of lesion (p 0.05). Otherwise,
      the side effects were less frequent in the group treated with blue light.
      CONCLUSIONS: Blue light irradiation was as effective as benzoyl peroxide in acne
      treatment grades II and III but there were fewer side effects.

TI  - A review of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of acne vulgaris.
PG  - 1010-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is increasing in dermatology. Antibiotic
      resistance and the challenges of isotretinoin therapy have led to investigation of
      PDT in the treatment of acne vulgaris. OBJECTIVE: To review the results of clinical
      trials and case series with respect to light source, topical photosensitizing agent,
      adverse events, efficacy and skin type. METHODS: A non-critical review is presented
      of a PubMed search for studies examining PDT in the treatment of acne vulgaris.
      RESULTS: The authors found 21 clinical trials and case series of various designs.
      Eight studies employed a split-face design comparing photosensitizer to placebo, no
      treatment or another photosensitizer. Two trials used three test spots and one
      control spot per patient. Three studies utilized control subjects receiving no
      photosensitizer with or without light therapy. All 21 studies reported a reduction
      in inflammatory lesions and/or a significant improvement in acne. The light sources
      utilized included blue light, pulsed-dye laser (PDL), intense pulsed light (IPL) and
      red light. Studies comparing the use of PDT to light therapy alone demonstrated
      greater improvement in treatment groups pretreated with a photosensitizer.
      CONCLUSION: All studies reported reduction in inflammatory lesions or significant
      improvement in acne. Several studies confirm a light source combined with
      photosensitizer is superior to light alone. Adverse reactions including
      photosensitivity, pustular eruptions, and crusting varied among photosensitizers and
      light sources. PDT appears to be a useful therapeutic option for acne patients who
      are recalcitrant to standard treatments and poor candidates for systemic retinoids.
      Further studies are still needed before a consensus protocol can be established.
      Additional investigations are needed to establish optimal incubation time,
      activating light source and frequency of treatment.

TI  - Treatment of acne vulgaris using blue light photodynamic therapy in an
      African-American patient.
PG  - 669-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies indicate photodynamic therapy is an effective treatment of
      inflammatory acne lesions on patients with Fitzpatrick skin types 1-3. There is a
      lack of evidence in the literature regarding the use of photodynamic therapy to
      treat acne vulgaris in African American patients. This article reports the first
      case of blue light photodynamic therapy to treat moderate inflammatory facial acne
      on an African American patient with type 5 skin. OBSERVATIONS: This article
      describes a 26-year-old African American woman with moderate inflammatory facial
      acne vulgaris. On examination, she had over 15 inflammatory papules on her face and
      post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The patient had a history of treatment failure
      with the following therapies: topical benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics, topical
      retinoids and oral antibiotics. At presentation, the patient was using a combination
      topical benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin product in the morning and tazoratene gel in
      the evening without success. The patient was treated with 20% aminolevulinic
      acid/blue-light photodynamic therapy spaced monthly for a total of four treatments,
      a once-daily application of hydroquinone 4% cream and her existing topical regimen.
      The patient reported significant improvement of inflammatory acne lesions and
      post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation following two treatments with photodynamic
      therapy and was virtually clear of all acne lesions after the third treatment.
      CONCLUSION: Photodynamic therapy is an emerging remedy for patients with acne
      vulgaris resistant to standard treatment, particularly in patients with skin of
      color who are more sensitive to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. In this
      African-American patient, 20% aminolevulinic acid/blue-light photodynamic therapy
      was effective in treating facial acne vulgaris.

AB  - Modern acne therapy uses anticomedogenic, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory,and
      antiandrogenic substances. As an additional approach in recent years, treatments
      have been developed based on the application of electromagnetic radiation. Visible
      light or infrared wave lengths are utilized by most techniques, including blue light
      lamps, intense pulsed light, photodynamic therapy and lasers. This review evaluates
      the various methods with regard to efficacy and their current role in the management
      of acne. Although UV radiation has been frequently used to treat acne, it is now
      regarded as obsolete due to the unfavorable risk-benefit ratio. Visible light,
      especially of blue wavelengths, appears to be suitable for the treatment of mild to
      moderate inflammatory acne. Photodynamic therapy is effective, but, due to
      considerable immediate side effects, it is best reserved for selected situations.
      Despite promising observations, intense pulsed light and lasers have to be evaluated
      in further studies, before they can be recommended.

TI  - Self-diagnosis of Mild-to-Moderate Acne for Self Treatment with Blue Light Therapy.
PG  - 40-4
AB  - This study was an evaluation of self-applied, blue light, light-emitting diode
      therapy in the treatment of mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne on the face and
      associated labeling to determine if subjects are capable of self diagnosing their
      condition and whether they are capable of self-administrating treatment. Subjects
      included had no prior experience with the device. They were given the device and a
      copy of the labeling. Based on their own assessment, they were evaluated for their
      comprehension of the device and for its intended use. The study, which comprised 18
      females and three males with an average age of 31, demonstrated that all
      participants (100%) were capable of correctly identifying their acne condition. The
      labeling, which was key to educating users in recognizing their acne type, included
      clear descriptions of different categories of acne. The study also demonstrated that
      the user was capable of self administering the treatment based solely on the
      device's labeling and without the supervision of a medical doctor.

TI  - Clinical Efficacy of Self-applied Blue Light Therapy for Mild-to-Moderate Facial
      Acne.
PG  - 44-50
AB  - This study was an evaluation of the performance of self-applied, blue light,
      light-emitting diode therapy in the treatment of mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne
      on the face, concerning: 1) time to improvement and/or resolution of the number of
      blemishes and lesions on the face; 2) quality of skin condition; 3) occurrence and
      count of the number of new blemishes and lesions; and 4) ease of product use;
      patient comfort, wellbeing, and satisfaction during the treatment period; and safety
      of treatment. Subjects (N=21) were included according to the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria and after they had given informed consent. The blue light treatment was
      conducted over an eight-week period. For study data management and analysis, SPSS
      16.0 statistical software was used. Data management and analysis was performed
      independently using, where appropriate, ANOVA, student t-test, and Mann-Whitney test
      for N=20. Tests were carried out at the five-percent significance level. The
      confidence interval was 95 percent. Twenty-one subjects concluded the study (18/21
      were female and 3/21 were male). Upon the first outbreak of acne, subjects had a
      mean age of 15 years (range 8-28 years), and 19 subjects had mild-to-moderate acne
      for a mean duration of 13.1 years. During the study period with self-applied blue
      light treatment, the total number of comedones on the face had significantly reduced
      for the assessment at Day 7 (p<0.019) and at Day 28 (p<0.001). The total number of
      open comedones (blackheads) on the face during the treatment period was reduced
      significantly (p<0.02) for assessment at treatment Day 7 (p<0.005) and for the
      assessment at Day 28. The total number of closed comedones (whiteheads) on the face
      during the treatment period, was reduced significantly (p<0.007) for the assessment
      at Day 28. The total number of papules during treatment had reduced significantly
      for assessment at Day 7 (p<0.048) and Day 28 (p<0.005). The total number of pustules
      during treatment had reduced, but this difference was not statistically significant.
      This was similar for nodules present. Subjects expressed confidence in using the
      self-applied blue light without the supervision of a doctor. Regarding previous
      treatments, subjects expressed dissatisfaction and considered self-applied blue
      light treatment to be better for their condition. Self-applied blue light treatment
      was reported to be easy and safe to use.

      review.
PG  - 1273-85

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne is common and can lead to scarring of the skin, as well as to
      psychological distress and reduced self-esteem. Most topical or oral treatments for
      acne are inconvenient and have side-effects. Laser and other light therapies have
      been reported to be convenient, safe and effective in treating acne. OBJECTIVES: To
      carry out a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of light and laser
      therapies for acne vulgaris. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, LILACS, ISI Science Citation
      Index and Dissertation Abstracts International for relevant published trials.
      RESULTS: We identified 25 trials (694 patients), 13 of light therapy and 12 of light
      therapy plus light-activated topical cream (photodynamic therapy, PDT). Overall, the
      results from trials of light alone were disappointing, but the trials of blue light,
      blue-red light and infrared radiation were more successful, particularly those using
      multiple treatments. Red-blue light was more effective than topical 5% benzoyl
      peroxide cream in the short term. Most trials of PDT showed some benefit, which was
      greater with multiple treatments, and better for noninflammatory acne lesions.
      However, the improvements in inflammatory acne lesions were not better than with
      topical 1% adapalene gel, and the side-effects of therapy were unacceptable to many
      participants. CONCLUSIONS: Some forms of light therapy were of short-term benefit.
      Patients may find it easier to comply with these treatments, despite the initial
      discomfort, because of their short duration. However, very few trials compared light
      therapy with conventional acne treatments, were conducted in patients with severe
      acne or examined long-term benefits of treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition that affects 8 out of 10
      people. It varies from mild to severe, and different treatments target various
      aspects of the disease. Propionibacterium acnes, one of the culprits involved in the
      pathogenesis of acne vulgaris, is the main target of all major medical treatments
      used. Studies conducted in recent years have shown favorable effects within the
      visible light spectrum for the treatment of acne vulgaris. OBJECTIVE: In this study,
      we have evaluated the use of intense blue light within the spectral range of 415-425
      nm (peak 420 nm) in the treatment of acne vulgaris. METHODS: Twenty-one patients
      with mild to moderate facial acne were treated with blue light phototherapy. All
      patients were given 14-min treatment sessions twice a week for 4 weeks. Acne
      severity was assessed using the Leeds Technique for grading and lesion counts.
      Disability was assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). In
      addition, standard digital and cross-polarized light photographs were taken and
      graded by a blinded evaluator. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores and cultures for P.
      acnes were carried out before starting the treatment and upon completion of the
      treatment. RESULTS: Significant improvement was achieved in the Leeds Acne Grade (P
      = 0.001). The inflammatory (P = 0.001) and noninflammatory (P = 0.06) lesion counts
      also improved significantly. A similar change was noted in the DLQI (P = 0.001); a
      degree of significance was also achieved in the patients' and the investigators' VAS
      scores (P = 0.01 and P = 0.001, respectively). P. acnes colony counts failed to show
      a significant decrease at the end of the treatment and remained almost constant (P =
      0.660). CONCLUSIONS: We believe that blue light does appear to have some role in the
      management of acne and may be beneficial for the treatment of a select group of mild
      to moderate acne patients.

AB  - Acne is a very prevalent skin disorder, affecting more than 85% of adolescents and
      often continuing into adulthood. Active acne and its sequelae, especially permanent
      scarring, may cause longstanding psychological or emotional harm in patients. Novel
      and promising treatments with laser/light devices (such as blue light, red light,
      pulsed dye laser, infrared lasers, light-emitting diodes, and pulsed light) have
      been reported to have varying degrees of efficacy for treatment. The authors
      compiled a summary of evidence-based literature on laser/light treatment for acne to
      assist clinicians to more appropriately identify treatment options, should they
      choose to supplement current medical antiacne therapies.

AB  - Acne surgery is the use of various surgical procedures for the treatment of postacne
      scarring and also, as adjuvant treatment for active acne. Surgery is indicated both
      in active acne and post-acne scars. PHYSICIANS' QUALIFICATIONS: Any Dermatologist
      can perform most acne surgery techniques as these are usually taught during
      postgraduation. However, certain techniques such as dermabrasion, laser resurfacing,
      scar revisions need specific "hands-on" training in appropriate training centers.
      FACILITY: Most acne surgery procedures can be performed in a physician's minor
      procedure room. However, full-face dermabrasion and laser resurfacing need an
      operation theatre in a hospital setting. ACTIVE ACNE: Surgical treatment is only an
      adjunct to medical therapy, which remains the mainstay of treatment. Comedone
      extraction is a process of applying simple mechanical pressure with a comedone
      extractor, to extract the contents of the blocked pilosebaceous follicle.
      Superficial chemical peel is a process of applying a chemical agent to the skin, so
      as to cause controlled destruction of the epidermis leading to exfoliation. Glycolic
      acid, salicylic acid and trichloroacetic acid are commonly used peeling agents for
      the treatment of active acne and superficial acne scars. CRYOTHERAPY: Cryoslush and
      cryopeel are used for the treatment of nodulocystic acne. Intralesional
      corticosteroids are indicated for the treatment of nodules, cysts and keloidal acne
      scars. Nonablative lasers and light therapy using Blue light, non ablative
      radiofrequency, Nd:YAG laser, IPL (Intense Pulsed Light), PDT (Photodynamic
      Therapy), pulse dye laser and light and heat energy machines have been used in
      recent years for the treatment of active inflammatory acne and superficial acne
      scars. Proper counseling is very important in the treatment of acne scars. Treatment
      depends on the type of acne scars; a patient may need more than one type of
      treatment. Subcision is a treatment to break the fibrotic strands that tether the
      scar to the underlying subcutaneous tissue, and is useful for rolling scars. Punch
      excision techniques such as punch excision, elevation and replacement are useful for
      depressed scars such as ice pick and boxcar scars. TCA chemical reconstruction of
      skin scars (CROSS) (Level C) is useful for ice pick scars. Resurfacing techniques
      include ablative methods (such as dermabrasion and laser resurfacing), and
      nonablative methods such as microdermabrasion and nonablative lasers. Ablative
      methods cause significant postoperative changes in the skin, are associated with
      significant healing time and should be performed by dermatosurgeons trained and
      experienced in the procedure. Fillers are useful for depressed scars. Proper case
      selection is very important in ensuring satisfactory results.

AB  - The successful treatment of acne still remains problematic. Conventional therapies
      often prove inconsistent with unacceptable side effects and recurrence rates,
      leading to patient noncompliance. A thermal phototherapy treatment using a
      combination of blue light and red light has recently attracted much attention and
      seems to offer an effective alternative. The objective of this study was to evaluate
      the efficacy of blue light (415 nm) in combination with red light (633 nm) in the
      reduction of inflammatory lesions on the face of subjects (n=21) with mild to
      moderate acne vulgaris after a course of 8 20-minute (blue) or 30-minute (red)
      alternated light treatments, self-administered by a handheld unit over a period of 4
      weeks. Lesion counts progressively reduced throughout the 4-week light therapy
      period and continued to reduce up to 8 weeks posttherapy, with a final average
      reduction of 69% seen 8 weeks after the treatment course (P>.001). This pattern is
      similar to previously reported studies.

TI  - Photopneumatic technology for the treatment of acne vulgaris.
PG  - 139-45
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treatment of acne vulgaris with light sources necessitates multiple
      targets including Propionibacterium acnes and sebaceous glands. Traditional light
      sources such as blue light capitalize on P acnes bacteria as targets while infrared
      lasers and radiofrequency devices target the sebaceous gland. A novel device
      combining vacuum and a unique broadband light source was designed to combine
      multiple targets for the effective treatment of acne. The objective of this study
      was to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a novel device that uses a combination
      of broadband light and pneumatic energy for the treatment of acne vulgaris. METHODS:
      In a retrospective multicenter study, clinical data were collected from 56 patients
      with mild to severe acne. Patients had been treated 2 to 4 times with a portable
      photopneumatic device (Aesthera PPx, Aesthera Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) that
      delivers broadband light (400 to 1200 nm) to the treatment site via a hand piece.
      For 11 of the 56 patients, 3 independent physicians blinded to the study treatment
      or duration evaluated PPx efficacy by comparing photographs taken before and after
      PPx treatment. RESULTS: For the 56 patients, the median physician-rated clearance
      increased from 50% after a single treatment to 90% after the fourth treatment,
      whereas the median patient-rated clearance improved from 50% after a single
      treatment to 78% after the fourth treatment. On a 4-point scale, both
      physician-rated and patient-rated median overall satisfaction levels increased from
      a 3 after a single treatment, to 4 after the second, third, and fourth treatments.
      Clinically significant adverse events were not observed. For the 11 patients
      evaluated by photography, the median papule and pustule lesion counts decreased from
      8 to 3 and from 2 to 0, respectively. Median acne severity (Burton scale) decreased
      from 4 before treatment to 2 after the final treatment, and the median improvement
      was 4.5 (scale 1-5). The median erythema rating decreased from 2 before treatment to
      1 after the final treatment (scale 1-4). Adverse events were limited to mild
      erythema. The median acne clearance was 3 (scale 1-4). CONCLUSION: Photopneumatic
      technology provides a safe and effective treatment of mild to severe acne vulgaris.

TI  - Ultrastructural evidence for thermal injury to pilosebaceous units during the
      treatment of acne using photopneumatic (PPX) therapy.
PG  - 7-11
LID - 10.1080/14764170701762427 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acne is a very prevalent skin disorder, and several
      devices, such as blue light, pulsed dye laser, diode laser, LED, RF and pulsed light
      systems, have been reported to have varying degrees of efficacy for treatment.
      Photopneumatic therapy (PPX) is a novel technology that combines pneumatic energy
      with a broadband light source to manipulate the optical characteristics of the skin.
      A vacuum suction raises target structures in the dermis closer to the surface of the
      skin prior to exposure, allowing for more efficient energy transmission. This study
      tested the hypothesis that a combination of pulsed light and suction would affect
      sebaceous plugging within diseased pilosebaceous apparati at a histological level,
      resulting in the rapid clearance of acne lesions. METHODS: Eight individuals were
      treated with PPX once per week for a total of five treatments. Punch biopsies of the
      treated areas were obtained just after the first exposure, just before the third
      exposure and immediately after the fifth exposure. Those specimens were examined by
      conventional and by electron microscopy for any alterations following treatment.
      RESULTS: Immediately following the first treatment, the mechanical extrusion of
      comedo contents from the infundibulum was observed histologically. One week after
      the second treatment, thermally injured bacteria as well as direct thermal injury to
      pilosebaceous apparati were observed ultrastructurally. CONCLUSION: These results
      correlate with clinical reports on decreased sebaceous gland activity after PPX
      treatment and may mechanistically give rise to the rapid regression of acne lesions.

TI  - A comparison of intense pulsed light, combination radiofrequency and intense pulsed
      light, and blue light in photodynamic therapy for acne vulgaris.
PG  - 1010-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is an
      emerging modality for the treatment of acne vulgaris. However, optimal therapeutic
      protocols have not been established. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacies of 3
      different light sources for activating ALA-induced protoporphyrin IX for the
      treatment of acne vulgaris. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with moderate to severe
      acne vulgaris were randomly assigned to receive ALA-PDT with photoactivation by
      intense pulsed light (IPL, 600-850 nm), a combination of IPL (580-980 nm) and
      bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energies, or blue light (417 nm). Each patient received
      3 ALA-PDT sessions at 2-week intervals. Follow-up evaluations were conducted 1 and 3
      months after the final treatment. RESULTS: At 1 month and 3 months, median lesion
      count reduction percentages were highest with IPL activation and lowest with blue
      light activation, although the differences did not reach statistical significance.
      At 1 month and 3 months, median investigator-assessed improvements were highest with
      IPL activation and lowest with blue light activation. The variability of responses
      was significantly smaller with IPL activation than with either RF-IPL or blue light
      activation. CONCLUSION: ALA-PDT with activation by IPL appears to provide greater,
      longer-lasting, and more consistent improvement than either RF-IPL or blue light
      activation in the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris.

TI  - Efficacy of ALA-PDT vs blue light in the treatment of acne.
PG  - 186-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is based on the principle of using light
      excitation of a wavelength-specific endogenous or exogenous photosensitizer to
      destroy the target tissue, and has shown efficacy in the treatment of certain
      non-melanoma skin cancers. PDT using aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) has attracted
      attention in the treatment of acne vulgaris. METHOD: Twenty patients with moderate
      to severe acne vulgaris on the face were treated with four sessions of topical
      ALA-PDT with blue light (415 nm) on the right side of the face compared with blue
      light alone on the left side of the face, each treatment being 1 week apart. Ten
      percent of topical ALA was applied to acne spots on the right side of the face with
      a 1-h incubation period and the entire face was treated with 48 J/cm(2) of 415 +/- 5
      nm light from an articulated LED planar array. Evaluation was performed by counting
      acne lesions at baseline, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after the beginning of the
      treatment. Biophysical measurements included sebum levels and the erythema, and
      melanin indices. RESULT: At the given assessment times 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after
      the beginning of the treatment, the mean percent reduction in inflamed lesions
      counts tended to be higher in the ALA-PDT areas; it was 32%, 50.9%, 65.9% and 71.1%,
      respectively, compared with the blue-light-alone treatment, which was 20.7%, 27%,
      57.7% and 56.7%, respectively, but without any statistical significance (P=0.092).
      There was no demonstrable significant change in sebum excretion, erythema or the
      melanin index after treatment. The side effects were pain, stinging, peeling,
      erythema, pruritus, oozing and pustules. These side effects were stronger on the
      ALA-PDT-treated side. CONCLUSION: From this study, the trend for ALA-PDT with blue
      light to be superior to blue light alone was observed, but it did not reach
      statistical significance. ALA-PDT had more side effects.

TI  - Combination of a new radiofrequency device and blue light for the treatment of acne
      vulgaris.
PG  - 838-40
AB  - Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease treated by physicians. Current topical
      and oral treatments may have short- and long-term negative consequences. Since
      radiofrequency (RF) energy has been shown to reduce sebum production and 410-nm blue
      light has been shown to kill Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) cells, these
      modalities in combination should be a highly effective treatment of acne vulgaris
      with little or no downtime or risk. This case report describes the efficacy and
      safety of RF energy (Accent, Alma Lasers Inc, Buffalo Grove, IL) and blue light

TI  - Comparative benefit of two thermal spring waters after photodynamic therapy
      procedure.
PG  - 31-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used to treat actinic
      keratoses, superficial cutaneous carcinoma, photodamage, and/or acne. The aim of
      this study was to compare the usefulness of Avène thermal spring water (ATSW), a low
      mineral content spring water, to a high mineral content spring water. We evaluated
      post-PDT clinical symptoms and findings when used as an adjunctive therapy in
      postprocedure skin care. METHODS: A double-blind monocentric comparative study was
      conducted on 25 patients suffering from either vulgaris acne or photodamage with or
      without actinic keratoses. The patients were treated with 5-aminolevulinic acid
      (5-ALA) activated with an intense pulsed light and/or blue light source. Patients
      were randomized so that 12 patients treated their faces with ATSW and 13 were
      treated with a comparative water spray. Clinical signs were evaluated by the
      investigator at day 0, before and 15 min after the first spraying, at days 2, 4, and
      7, and each day from day 0 to day 6 by patients. Clinical signs (erythema, stinging,
      pruritus, pain, and tightening) were evaluated by the use of a 4-point grading
      scale. RESULTS: The intragroup analysis showed that pain was significantly reduced
      by ATSW spraying at days 2, 4, and 7. The evaluation by patients showed that only
      ATSW alleviates pain from day 3 to day 6. The between-group analysis revealed that
      pruritus was significantly reduced by ATSW at day 7. Erythema, stinging, and
      tightening were not significantly reduced by both waters. Patients wished to
      continue using ATSW in 83% of cases. CONCLUSION: This comparative clinical trial
      demonstrates that ATSW, a low mineral content spring water, can be useful after
      ALA-PDT in reducing postprocedure cutaneous inflammation and patient discomfort
      better than a high mineral content spring water.

TI  - A new targeted blue light phototherapy for the treatment of acne.
PG  - 32-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of blue light phototherapy on inflammatory acne lesions were
      recently investigated. Many reports have used high-intensity, narrow-band 420 nm
      UV-free blue light delivery systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate a new
      blue light system (MultiClear) for targeted blue light phototherapy. METHOD: Ten
      Japanese patients with acne on the face or back were treated with targeted blue
      light once or twice a week. Acne severity was graded according to the acne severity
      score suggested by Allen and Smith (1982). If the acne was prevalent on the back or
      chest, the acne severity score of Burton et al. (1971) was adopted. The new
      targeting blue light system is equipped with a flexible optical light guide as a
      delivery system and the treatment device is placed directly only on the affected
      area. RESULT: Of the 10 patients, eight had a significantly reduced acne severity
      score without any side effects. Although two patients discontinued the study because
      of unsatisfactory results, none of the patients showed any harmful side effects from
      the targeted blue light phototherapy. CONCLUSION: Targeted blue light phototherapy
      with MultiClear is effective for the treatment of inflammatory acne lesions. This
      new irradiation device offers some advantages over previous blue light systems.

TI  - Light/laser therapy in the treatment of acne vulgaris.
PG  - 318-20
AB  - Acne vulgaris is one of the most prevalent skin diseases known. As common as this
      condition is, the social and psychological consequences are limitless. Although
      current treatments are available and include topical or oral antibiotics, it is
      crucial to develop a less risky and more effective therapy such as light/laser
      therapy. This article focuses specifically on the benefits of the light/laser
      treatment on acne vulgaris. Porphyrins accumulated in the bacteria,
      Propionibacterium acnes, one of the etiologic factors involved in the pathogenesis,
      allows phototherapy to be a successful modality. They have specific absorption peaks
      at which lasers have optimal effects. The longer the wavelength of the light is, the
      deeper its penetration and thus the greater its damage to the sebaceous glands.
      Although blue light is best for the activation of porphyrins, red light is best for
      deeper penetration and an anti-inflammatory effect. Ultraviolet (UV) light, although
      it may have initial an anti-inflammatory effects, has been proven to be potentially
      carcinogenic and have adverse effects such as aging (by UV-A) and burning (by UV-B).
      Previous studies indicate successful long-term intervention and selective damage of
      the sebaceous glands by using a diode laser with indocyanine green (ICG) dye.
      Mid-infrared lasers have been found to decrease lesion counts while also reducing
      the oiliness of skin and the scarring process. Nonablative laser treatment of acne
      scars using the Er:YAG laser with a short-pulsed mode has been successful in
      reducing the appearance of scars by stimulating neocollagenesis. The light/laser
      therapy has started to be explored with promising results in highly selected
      patients that require further investigation in greater populations and well-designed
      protocols.

TI  - The use of photodynamic therapy for treatment of acne vulgaris.
PG  - 47-57
AB  - Current topical and most oral therapies for acne vulgaris have limited efficacy,
      especially in moderate to severe cases. Photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic
      acid and recently methyl aminolevulinate has been shown to be a safe and effective
      modality for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Consensus guidelines suggest that 30 to
      60 minutes is sufficient 5-aminolevulinic acid contact time before photoactivation
      with blue light, red light, yellow light, broadband light, halogen, or pulsed dye
      laser devices. An average of three treatment can yield significant long-term
      improvement.

TI  - Blue and red light combination LED phototherapy for acne vulgaris in patients with
      skin phototype IV.
PG  - 180-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Blue light is effective for acne treatment, inducing
      photodynamic destruction of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). This study was
      designed to investigate the efficacy of combined blue and red light-emitting diode
      (LED) phototherapy for acne vulgaris. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients
      with mild to moderately severe facial acne were treated with quasimonochromatic LED
      devices, alternating blue (415 nm) and red (633 nm) light. The treatment was
      performed twice a week for 4 weeks. Objective assays of the skin condition were
      carried out before and after treatment at each treatment session. Clinical
      assessments were conducted before treatment, after the 2nd, 4th, and 6th treatment
      sessions and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the final treatment by grading and lesion
      counting. RESULTS: The final mean percentage improvements in non-inflammatory and
      inflammatory lesions were 34.28% and 77.93%, respectively. Instrumental measurements
      indicated that the melanin levels significantly decreased after treatment.
      Brightened skin tone and improved skin texture were spontaneously reported by 14
      patients. CONCLUSION: Blue and red light combination LED phototherapy is an
      effective, safe and non-painful treatment for mild to moderately severe acne
      vulgaris, particularly for papulopustular acne lesions.

PG  - 198-204
AB  - Acne is a frequent skin disease with abnormalities in the process of keratinization,
      sebaceous gland functioning and inflammation. In this review, our understanding of
      the pathogenesis of acne has been updated. An overview of efficacy and side effects
      of available anti-acne treatments is presented. Based on the present overview a
      recommendation for the treatment of various manifestations of acne is provided, also
      reconciling beneficial combinations of treatments. It is attractive to speculate
      that the increased insight into the pathogenesis of acne will create new treatment
      options. Challenging new options comprise blue light, photodynamic therapy, retinoic
      acid metabolism blocking agents and inhibitors of Th-1 cytokines.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory properties of narrow-band blue light.
PG  - 605-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Narrow-band blue light (420 nm) has demonstrated safety and efficacy in
      the treatment of acne vulgaris. It works by exhibiting a phototoxic effect on the
      heme metabolism of Propionibacterium acnes. Previous studies using blue light showed
      more improvement in inflammatory lesions than in comedones, as well as some
      improvement on the untreated side. Cytokines have demonstrated a critical role in
      the development of inflammation. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such
      as IL-1alpha have been shown to result in the expression of vascular and dermal
      adhesion molecules, the chemoattraction of inflammatory cells, and the stimulation
      of other inflammatory mediators. In addition, UVB radiation serves as a potent
      modulator of cell-mediated immune responses. PURPOSE: This study investigated the
      effect of narrow-band blue light on the inflammatory process in the presence and
      absence of cytokines and UVB using IL-1alpha and ICAM-1 as markers for inflammation.
      METHODS: Two immortalized keratinocyte cell lines were compared: HaCaT, produced by
      spontaneous immortalization of a genetically altered cell line, and hTERT, obtained
      by stable transfection of primary cell culture with human telomerase reverse
      transcriptase. Cells were treated with INF-y and TNF-alpha and exposed to UVB (312
      nm at 50 mJ/cm2) and/or blue light (420 nm at 54 mJ/cm2 and 134 mJ/cm2). The
      expression of IL-1alpha and ICAM-1 was measured by quantitative ELISA. RESULTS: The
      results showed that blue light and low-dose UVB treatment of HaCaT and hTERT cells
      resulted in inhibition of cytokine-induced production of IL-1alpha. The level of
      IL-1alpha decreased by 82% in HaCaT and by 75% in hTERT cells when exposed to blue
      light. It decreased by 95% in HaCaT and by 91% in hTERT cells when blue light was
      used in combination with UVB. ICAM-1 expression was similarly reduced in HaCaT, but
      not in hTERT cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that narrow-band blue light has
      anti-inflammatory effects on keratinocytes by decreasing the cytokine-induced
      production of IL-1alpha and ICAM-1. In addition, blue light demonstrated synergistic
      effects with low-dose UVB light. These results expand the properties of narrow-band
      blue light in modulating the inflammatory process and will facilitate testing of its
      phototherapeutic applications in different inflammatory skin conditions.

AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) takes advantage of our understanding of the cutaneous
      response to topically applied porphyrins to selectively destroy malignant or
      premalignant cells. This type of therapy has been used to treat a variety of
      cutaneous diseases, including actinic keratoses, basal cell carcinoma, acne, and
      others. The treatment protocols are not standardized across institutions. We present
      the Henry Ford Dermatology protocol and early results of our first 150 treatments

TI  - Combination blue (415 nm) and red (633 nm) LED phototherapy in the treatment of mild
      to severe acne vulgaris.
PG  - 71-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acne vulgaris represents both a challenge to the treating
      dermatologist and a major concern for the patient. Conventional treatments have
      proved inconsistent with often unacceptable side effects and high rates of
      recurrence. Non-thermal, non-laser, phototherapy for acne with a combination of blue
      and red light has recently attracted attention. The present study was designed to
      assess the efficacy of this combination phototherapy. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects,
      Fitzpatrick skin types II-V, with mild to severe symmetric facial acne vulgaris were
      recruited for the study. Subjects were well matched at baseline in terms of both age
      and duration of acne. Subjects were treated over eight sessions, two per week 3 days
      apart, alternating between 415 nm blue light (20 minutes/session, 48 J/cm2) and 633
      nm red light (20 minutes/session, 96 J/cm2) from a light-emitting diode (LED)-based
      therapy system. Patients received a mild microdermabrasion before each session. Acne
      was assessed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients
      completed the trial. A mean reduction in lesion count was observed at all follow-up
      points. At the 4-week follow-up, the mean lesion count reduction was significant at
      46% (p=0.001). At the 12-week follow-up, the mean lesion count reduction was also
      significant at 81% (p=0.001). Patient and dermatologist assessments were similar.
      Severe acne showed a marginally better response than mild acne. Side effects were
      minimal and transitory. Comedones did not respond as well as inflammatory lesions.
      CONCLUSIONS: Combination blue and red LED therapy appears to have excellent
      potential in the treatment of mild to severe acne. Treatment appears to be both
      pain- and side effect-free.

TI  - Light-emitting diode 415 nm in the treatment of inflammatory acne: an open-label,
      multicentric, pilot investigation.
PG  - 31-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of acne remains a challenge, with current therapies
      linked to significant side effects and patient non-compliance. Phototherapy using
      blue light has been proven in the treatment of acne vulgaris and offers the
      clinician an effective alternative. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of narrowband
      light-emitting diode (LED) blue light in the reduction of inflammatory and
      non-inflammatory lesions in patients with mild to moderate acne and to evaluate
      patient tolerance of the therapy. METHODS: Forty-five patients were treated with
      high-intensity pure blue light, 415 nm and 48 J/cm2, receiving two treatments of 20
      minutes per week for a period of 4-8 weeks. Clinical assessment was performed at
      baseline, and 2, 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. A patient's therapeutic response was
      measured using a global improvement scoring system. RESULTS: The mean improvement
      score was 3.14 at 4 weeks and 2.90 at 8 weeks. Nine patients experienced complete
      clearing at 8 weeks. The treatment was well tolerated, with 50% of patients highly
      satisfied with the treatment. CONCLUSION: This open-label study suggests the
      therapeutic efficacy of high-intensity LED pure blue light in the treatment of acne
      vulgaris with no reported side effects.

TI  - Long-pulsed dye laser-mediated photodynamic therapy combined with topical therapy
      for mild to severe comedonal, inflammatory, or cystic acne.
PG  - 45-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne patients who fail to respond to conventional treatments have been
      treated with isotretinoin, an effective treatment coming under strict regulation due
      to the risk of significant side effects. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be a viable
      alternative treatment for recalcitrant acne of various types and levels of severity.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of combination PDT with topical
      5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and activation by long-pulsed, pulsed dye laser (LP PDL,
      595 nm) energy with topical therapy in patients with mild to severe acne. METHODS: A
      prospective, controlled pilot, proof-of-principle study of 19 consecutive patients
      (aged 16-47 years, Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI) with mild to severe cystic,
      inflammatory, or comedonal acne of the face was conducted. All patients had failed
      conventional therapy, including oral antibiotics, topical treatments, hormonal
      therapy, laser procedures (without ALA), and/or oral isotretinoin. Fifteen patients
      were treated with ALA PDT and 4 patients served as controls; all were continued on
      topical medications. Patients undergoing PDT were initially randomized to receive
      either blue light or laser energy. Because recrudescence occurred in 1 patient while
      undergoing multiple treatments with ALA and blue light, all subsequent patients were
      treated with ALA and laser energy. The total number of patients treated with LP
      PDL-mediated ALA PDT was 14. ALA was applied for a short 45-minute incubation
      followed by 1 minimally overlapping pass with the LP PDL (595 nm, 7.0-7.5 J/cm2
      fluence, 10-ms pulse duration, 10-mm spot size, and dynamic cooling spray of 30 ms
      with a 30-ms delay). Patients treated with conventional therapy (oral antibiotics,
      oral contraceptives, and topical medications) or laser energy without ALA PDT served
      as control groups. Patients were followed monthly for up to 13 months. RESULTS:
      Complete clearance was achieved in 100% (14 out of 14) patients in the LP PDL
      PDT-treated group. A mean of 2.9 treatments (range 1-6; 2.0-3.7, 95% CI; n=14) was
      required to achieve complete clearance for a mean follow-up time of 6.4 months
      (range 1-13; 3.8-8.9 95% CI; n=14). The patient mean percent lesional clearance rate
      per treatment was 77% (64%-90%, 95% CI; n=14). Improvement in acne lesions became
      apparent within 1 to 2 weeks after the first treatment. Clearance in the LP PDL PDT
      group was superior to control groups. In the LP PDL-only control group (n=2), the
      patient mean percent lesional clearance rate per treatment was 32% without complete
      clearance after 3 to 4 treatments. In the oral antibiotics, oral contraceptives, and
      topicals control group (n=2), the clearance rate per treatment was 20%, the mean
      clearance rate per month was 4%, and complete clearance was not achieved after 6 to
      10 months. In the LP PDL-mediated PDT group, treatments were well-tolerated with
      minimal erythema lasting 1 to 2 days. No cases of crusting, blistering, purpura,
      scarring, or dyspigmentation occurred. A reduction in the erythema in erythematous
      acne scars was observed. CONCLUSION: For teenage to adult patients with recalcitrant
      comedonal, inflammatory, or cystic acne of various degrees of severity, ALA PDT with
      activation by LP PDL appears to be a safe and effective treatment with minimal side
      effects. LP PDL-mediated PDT may serve as an important alternative to isotretinoin.
      Cosmetically well-accepted, LP PDL PDT combined with topical therapy is the first
      PDT modality to achieve complete clearance with long-term follow-up as compared to
      controls.

TI  - Laser-mediated photodynamic therapy.
PG  - 16-25
AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has evolved since its inception at the beginning of the
      20th century, when it was defined as an oxygen-dependent reaction between a
      photosensitizing dye and light. Photosensitizers and light sources have since been
      continually optimized for distinct applications and tissues. Systemic porphyrins,
      such as hematoporphyrin, were the first photosensitizers to be used, mostly to treat
      tumors. The first light sources used were broad-band, noncoherent lights, such as
      quartz, xenon, tungsten, or halogen lamps. The wavelengths of light chosen were
      based upon the absorption spectrum of porphyrins: blue because the largest peak is
      at 400 nm (the Soret band) and red because of its greater penetration depth but
      lesser absorption at 650 nm (a Q band). Systemic photosensitizers caused prolonged
      photosensitivity, and broad-band light sources had limitations and side effects. The
      development of topical photosensitizers, such as 5-aminolevulinic acid, and the
      advent of lasers in recent years have advanced PDT for cutaneous use. In the 1990s,
      red lasers were applied to PDT because of their increased skin penetration despite
      lesser absorption by porphyrins. Broad-band blue light and red light have been
      studied extensively, the former achieving Food and Drug Administration approval in
      combination with topical aminolevulinic acid for the treatment of actinic keratosis
      in 1997. These lasers and light sources caused significant side effects, such as
      discomfort, erythema, crusting, blistering, and dyspigmentation. The recent
      application of the long-pulsed pulsed dye laser (595 nm) after topical
      aminolevulinic acid greatly minimized side effects without compromising efficacy.
      Long-pulsed pulsed dye laser-mediated PDT has since been shown to be effective in
      treatment of actinic keratosis, actinic cheilitis, sebaceous hyperplasia, lichen
      sclerosus, and, most recently, acne vulgaris. Finally, intense pulsed light sources
      have been introduced to PDT for the treatment of photodamage and acne, offering
      advantages of versatility in wavelengths and applications.

TI  - An open study to determine the efficacy of blue light in the treatment of mild to
      moderate acne.
PG  - 219-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effective management of acne remains a challenge; achieving an
      optimal response whilst minimizing adverse events is often difficult. The rise in
      antibiotic resistance threatens to reduce the future usefulness of the current
      mainstay of therapy. The need for alternative therapies remains important.
      Phototherapy has previously been shown to be effective in acne, with renewed
      interest as both endogenous and exogenous photodynamic therapies are demonstrated
      for this condition. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of narrowband blue light in
      the reduction of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions in patients with mild to
      moderate acne and to evaluate patient tolerance of the therapy. METHODS: We
      performed an open study utilizing a blue LED light source in 30 subjects with mild
      to moderate facial acne. Two weeks after screening, lesions were counted and
      recorded by lesion type. Over 4 weeks, patients received eight 10- or 20-minute
      light treatments, peak wavelength 409-419 nm at 40 mW/cm2. Assessments were taken at
      weeks 5, 8 and 12 and lesion counts were recorded. Repeated measures-ANOVA and
      Dunnett's tests, respectively, allowed assessment of the different scores over time
      and permitted comparison of mean counts. RESULTS: An overall effect on inflammatory
      counts was observed at week 5, and a statistically significant decrease in inflamed
      counts was detected at the week 8 assessments, which continued to week 12. There was
      little effect on non-inflamed lesions. The treatment was well tolerated with adverse
      events experienced generally rated as being mild and usually self-limiting.
      CONCLUSIONS: Eight 10- or 20-minute treatments over 4 weeks with a narrowband blue
      light was found to be effective in reducing the number of inflamed lesions in
      subjects with mild to moderate acne. The treatment had little effect on the number
      of comedones. The onset of the effect was observable at the first assessment, at
      week 5, and maximal between weeks 8 and 12. Blue light phototherapy using a
      narrowband LED light source appears to be a safe and effective additional therapy
      for mild to moderate acne.

TI  - Our approach to pediatric dermatologic laser surgery.
PG  - 255-63
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many pediatric dermatological conditions may be
      successfully treated with laser surgery. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      clinical approach to various pediatric dermatological conditions utilizing laser
      treatment options is discussed. RESULTS: Clinical uses of various modalities such as
      pulsed dye laser, KTP laser, Nd-YAG laser, Q-switched ruby laser, erbium-YAG laser,
      diode laser, non-coherent blue light sources, and fractional resurfacing are
      presented with successful parameters, developed over 22 years, utilized on a daily
      basis in a laser surgery clinic. CONCLUSION: Laser surgery can make a significant
      improvement in many pediatric skin lesions, thanks to the unique properties of
      pediatric skin and a vast array of laser technologies.

TI  - Photodynamic therapy for cosmetic applications.
PG  - 242-52
AB  - With the advent of short contact and pulsed light techniques, topical
      5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (5-ALA PDT) has become a viable clinical
      modality. Intense pulsed light, the pulsed dye laser, and blue light-emitting lamps
      have become the most commonly used devices in inducing a cosmetic PDT effect. More
      recently, by combining the photothermal effects of pulsed light with the
      photochemical effects of PDT, an enhanced cosmetic effect has been demonstrated in a
      variety of dermatologic conditions. In addition, the use of shorter 5-ALA incubation
      times allows for improved patient tolerance during treatment and subsequently fewer
      adverse effects in the postoperative period. A review of the current literature on
      cosmetic uses of PDT as well as our personal techniques are discussed in detail.

PG  - 1027-32
AB  - In recent years, a number of studies have evaluated the treatment of acne using
      electromagnetic waves, such as lasers, photodynamic therapy, visible light or radio
      waves. While the efficacy of laser treatment is still uncertain, photodynamic
      therapy shows promising results, but with marked side-effects, as destruction of
      sebaceous glands. Treatment with blue light (405-420 nm wavelength) also appears
      effective and can be regarded as an treatment option for inflammatory acne.

TI  - Photodynamic therapy for the treatment of acne: a pilot study.
PG  - S10-4
AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with use of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA, Levulan
      Kerastick, Dusa Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Wilmington, MA) photosensitizing agent is a
      new modality for the treatment of acne. Eighteen patients (aged 15 to 63) with
      moderate to severe inflammatory acne received ALA-PDT. ALA remained in contact with
      skin for 15 to 30 minutes before exposure to blue light (ClearLight [Lumenis] or
      BLU-U [Dusa Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]) or the Aurora DSR (Syneron Medical Ltd.), which
      uses Electro-Optical Synergy (ELOS), a unique combination of optical and
      radiofrequency (RF) energy. Patients received two to four ALA-PDT treatments over
      four to eight weeks or two cycles of ALA-PDT (weeks 2, 4) preceded by salicylic acid
      peel (weeks 1, 3) over four weeks. The average follow-up time was four months. On a
      scale of 0.0 to 4.0, the average acne grade improvement was 1.75. Among the 12
      patients who said their acne had improved, 11 had at least 50% improvement and five
      had more than 75% improvement. Adverse effects were limited to erythema and peeling
      for up to five days after treatment and one episode of impetiginization of the
      affected area. Patients with moderate to severe acne can achieve durable improvement
      with short-contact ALA-PDT.

TI  - 420 nm intense continuous light therapy for acne.
PG  - 156-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Topical antibiotics, isotretinoin or systemic antibiotics are usually
      used for acne therapy. However, isotretinoin cannot be used during pregnancy because
      it can cause significant birth defects while systemic antibiotics can have adverse
      side effects such as gastrointestinal irritation, photosensitivity and tetracycline
      sensitivity. Describe here is a high-intensity, narrow-band, blue light (ClearLight)
      system, and its therapeutic clinical effect is investigated on acne using cutaneous
      measurements, bacterial observations and ultrastructural changes. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A total of 28 adult healthy volunteers with facial acne (mean age 28.1
      years, range 16-56 years) were recruited for this study. They were treated with a
      total of eight serial biweekly 15-minute treatment sessions. Clinical counts of
      acne, as well as moisture, sebum and pH measurements were taken between each
      session. Nine of the 28 patients were followed for 2-3 months after the last
      treatment. Detection of bacteria in acne pustules was analyzed by culture and by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ultrastructural changes were examined in eight
      patients after four sessions of the light therapy. RESULTS: All patients completed
      the study. Overall, there was a 64.7% improvement in acne lesions. There were no
      bacterial changes before or after the therapy, although damaged Propionibacterium
      acnes were observed at the ultrastructural level. CONCLUSIONS: ClearLight performed
      eight times over 4 weeks can be useful in the treatment of acne. Further
      investigation will be needed to elucidate the mechanism of action of ClearLight.

TI  - Blue light phototherapy in the treatment of acne.
PG  - 266-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blue light irradiation is known to be effective against acne. However,
      the profile of a good candidate is still unclear. METHODS: Thirty-one Taiwanese with
      symmetrical facial acne were irradiated with blue light on one side of the face
      selected randomly twice weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. The other half of the face
      was left untreated as control. Parameters, including scar type, pore size, and
      facial follicular porphyrin fluorescence intensity, were documented. The severity of
      acne was assessed before the treatment, after two, four, and eight sessions of
      treatment, and 1 month after the treatment was completed. RESULTS: Compared with the
      non-irradiation side, eight sessions of blue light irradiation were effective in
      acne treatment (P<0.001). Gender (P=0.471), scar type (P-values of pitted, atrophic,
      and hypertrophic type were 0.688, 0.572, and 0.802, respectively), pore size
      (P=0.755), and pretreatment fluorescence intensity (P=0.656) could not be used as
      predictive factors of therapeutic effectiveness. Compared with pretreatment,
      nodulocystic lesions tended to worsen despite treatment. In addition, the
      therapeutic effectiveness was not related to the fluorescence intensity change
      (P=0.812). CONCLUSIONS: Blue light irradiation is effective in acne treatment.
      Patients without nodulocystic lesions are better candidates for blue light
      irradiation.

TI  - Phototherapy in the treatment of acne vulgaris: what is its role?
PG  - 211-6
AB  - Acne vulgaris is a common dermatosis affecting 80% of the population. To date,
      different treatments have been used to manage this condition. Antibacterials and
      retinoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for acne, but their success rate
      varies. Phototherapy is emerging as an alternative option to treat acne vulgaris.
      Studies examining the role of different wavelengths and methods of light treatment
      have shown that phototherapy with visible light, specifically blue light, has a
      marked effect on inflammatory acne lesions and seems sufficient for the treatment of
      acne. In addition, the combination of blue-red light radiation seems to be superior
      to blue light alone, with minimal adverse effects. Photodynamic therapy has also
      been used, even in nodular and cystic acne, and had excellent therapeutic outcomes,
      although with significant adverse effects. Recently, low energy pulsed dye laser
      therapy has been used, and seems to be a promising alternative that would allow the
      simultaneous treatment of active acne and acne scarring. Further studies are needed
      to clarify the role of phototherapy as a monotherapy or an adjuvant treatment in the
      current management of acne vulgaris.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, often suppurative skin
      condition which affects primarily apocrine glands. A variety of therapies have been
      used to treat HS, often with unsatisfactory results. Photodynamic therapy (PDT),
      utilizing topical 20% 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is being used to treat a variety
      of dermatologic skin concerns, including photorejuvenation and associated actinic
      keratoses, and acne vulgaris, and other skin tumors. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of these
      case reports is to evaluate the effectiveness of ALA-PDT in treating recalcitrant
      cases of HS. METHODS: Four patients, not responding to standard HS therapy,
      underwent short-contact ALA-PDT therapy utilizing a blue light for activation. One
      to two week intervals between therapies was utilized for 3-4 total treatments and
      follow-up was for 3 months following the last treatment. RESULTS: All four of the
      patients tolerated the therapies well. Clinical improvements from 75-100% were noted
      n 11 of the patients. No adverse effects were seen during the treatments. The
      treatments were pain free and there was no downtime associated with these ALA-PDT
      treatments. CONCLUSIONS: HS is a chronic disease which most dermatologists find
      difficult to treat. The use of ALA-PDT is finding an ever-expanding role in
      dermatology. These case studies support the use of ALA-PDT in cases of HS. Although

TI  - Large surface photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid: treatment of actinic
      keratoses and beyond.
PG  - S26-31
AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is currently
      approved in the US and Canada for the spot treatment of non-hypertrophic actinic
      keratoses of the face and scalp. Dermatologists are currently using ALA-PDT on
      larger skin surfaces for the treatment of extensive actinic keratoses, sun damage P
      and acne. This article reviews the safety and efficacy of large surface ALA-PDT for
      the treatment of actinic keratoses and photodamage. New data on the carcinogenic
      potential of weekly topical ALA-PDT in mice is also presented. Groups of hairless
      mice were treated weekly with either ALA alone, blue light alone or ALA-PDT using
      blue light for a total of 10 months followed by an additional 2 months or
      observation. Mice were examined weekly for the presence of skin tumors. Skin tumors
      were not observed in mice treated weekly with blue light alone, with topical
      application of ALA alone or with ALA-PDT.

TI  - Photodynamic therapy and topical aminolevulinic acid: an overview.
PG  - 699-708
AB  - Photodynamic therapy is a non-invasive technique used in the treatment of skin
      diseases which has various advantages, one being the ability to localize treatment
      to the area being treated, which is common among most photosensitizers.
      Aminolevulinic acid is a prodrug that is metabolized intracellularly to form the
      photosensitizing molecule protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). When PpIX is activated by light,
      cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and free radicals are generated. This phototoxic
      effect may cause malignant and non-malignant hyperproliferative tissue to be
      destroyed, to decrease in size, and to eventually disappear. The application of
      topical aminolevulinic acid 20% followed by the use of a blue light photodynamic
      therapy illuminator is indicated in the US for the treatment of non-hyperkeratotic
      actinic keratoses of the face or scalp. There are data suggesting that
      aminolevulinic acid/photodynamic therapy may also be beneficial in acne vulgaris,
      verrucae, psoriasis, mycosis fungoides, and human papillomavirus. This treatment
      modality has also proven effective in the management of skin cancer such as, Bowen
      disease and basal cell carcinoma. Further experience in the use of photodynamic
      therapy will help define its utility in the management of actinic keratosis and
      other dermatoses.

TI  - Proton magic angle spinning NMR reveals new features in photodynamically treated
      bacteria.
PG  - 401-7
AB  - The bacterium Propionibacterium acnes is light-sensitive due to porphyrin-induced
      photosensitization. The light sensitivity increases with incubation of
      5-aminolevulinic acid, ALA. For the first time, 1H magic angle spinning NMR
      spectroscopy is used to describe the photoinduced changes in the bacterium after ALA
      incubation. Successful photosensitization was performed with light-emitting diodes
      in the blue and red regions (430 and 654 nm, respectively). The irradiation setup,
      suitable for irradiation of bacterium suspensions in petri dishes is described. For
      NMR studies blue light diodes with about 90 micromol/m2s were chosen. After blue
      light irradiation, the endogenous glycine betaine, proline, glutamate and choline
      levels in P. acnes decreased with increasing irradiation time. For sublethal light
      doses (50% survival fraction), the endogenous glycine betaine level decreased 80% on
      average. The corresponding percentages for proline, choline and glutamate were about
      40, 25 and 10, respectively. It is hypothesized that the irradiation, inducing
      porphyrin photosensitization amplified by ALA incubation, leads to elimination of
      the osmolyte glycine betaine and possibly also proline by so-called regulatory
      volume decrease (RVD) mechanisms. These mechanisms are known to be active in several
      prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells when exposed to hypotonic stress. They are also
      known to be present in several eukaryotic cells during photodynamic therapy (PDT)
      exposure leading to hypotonoc stress. The findings contribute to the knowledge of
      the inactivation mechanisms of P. acnes in photosensitization, and could therefore
      be of interest in the efforts to use PDT as treatment of the acne disease.

TI  - The effective treatment of acne vulgaris by a high-intensity, narrow band 405-420 nm
      light source.
PG  - 111-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Available topical treatments are slow and frequently irritating. Oral
      therapies may be associated with increased bacterial resistance (antibiotics) or
      possible severe side effects (oral isotretinoin). In vitro and in vivo exposure of
      acne bacteria to 405-420 nm ultraviolet (UV) free blue light results in the
      photo-destruction of these bacteria through the effects on the porphyrins produced
      naturally by Propionibacterium acnes. A novel, high-intensity, narrow band 420 nm UV
      free blue light has been shown to decrease inflammatory acne lesions after eight
      bi-weekly treatments. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of high-intensity, narrow
      band 420 nm UV free blue light (ClearLight) on inflammatory acne lesions. METHODS:
      Three studies were carried out to examine the clinical effects of high-intensity,
      narrow band blue light on papulo-pustular acne: the split-face dose-response study,
      the full-face open trial and the split-face, double-blind controlled study. The
      studies enrolled 10, 13 and 23 patients respectively. RESULTS: The data show more
      than an 80% response to 420 nm acne phototherapy with a significant reduction of
      59-67% of inflammatory acne lesions after only eight treatments of 8-15 minutes. The
      reduction in lesions was steady in the follow-ups at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the end
      of therapy. Prolonged remission was evident in the 8 weeks after the end of therapy.
      No adverse effects or patient discomfort were noted in any of the patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Acne phototherapy by high intensity, narrow band 405-420 nm light is
      proven to be an attractive, fast, effective, non-invasive alternative to current
      topical and parenteral anti-acne remedies.

TI  - Eradication of Propionibacterium acnes by its endogenic porphyrins after
      illumination with high intensity blue light.
PG  - 17-24
AB  - Propionibacterium acnes is a Gram-positive, microaerophilic bacterium that causes
      skin wounds. It is known to naturally produce high amounts of intracellular
      porphyrins. The results of the present study confirm that the investigated strain of
      P. acnes is capable of producing endogenic porphyrins with no need for any trigger
      molecules. Extracts from growing cultures have demonstrated emission peaks around
      612 nm when excited at 405 nm, which are characteristic for porphyrins. Endogenic
      porphyrins were determined and quantified after their extraction from the bacterial
      cells by fluorescence intensity and by elution retention time on high-performance
      liquid chromatography (HPLC). The porphyrins produced by P. acnes are mostly
      coproporphyrin, as shown by the HPLC elution patterns. Addition of
      delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) enhanced intracellular porphyrin synthesis and
      higher amounts of coproporphyrin have been found. Eradication of P. acnes by its
      endogenic porphyrins was examined after illumination with intense blue light at
      407-420 nm. The viability of 24 h cultures grown anaerobically in liquid medium was
      reduced by less than two orders of magnitude when illuminated once with a light dose
      of 75 J cm(-2). Better photodynamic effects were obtained when cultures were
      illuminated twice or three times consecutively with a light dose of 75 J cm(-2) and
      an interval of 24 h between illuminations. The viability of the culture under these
      conditions decreased by four orders of magnitude after two illuminations and by five
      orders of magnitude after three illuminations. When ALA-triggered cultures were
      illuminated with intense blue light at a light dose of 75 J cm(-2) the viability of
      the treated cultures decreased by seven orders of magnitude. This decrease in
      viability can occur even after a single exposure of illumination for the indicated
      light intensity. X-ray microanalysis and transmission electron microscopy revealed
      structural damages to membranes in the illuminated P. acnes. Illumination of the
      endogenous coproporphyrin with blue light (407-420 nm) apparently plays a major role
      in P. acnes photoinactivation. A treatment protocol with a series of several
      illuminations or illumination after application of ALA may be suitable for curing
      acne. Treatment by both pathways may overcome the resistance of P. acnes to
      antibiotic treatment.

TI  - Less common methods to treat acne.
PG  - 68-73
AB  - Effective medications to treat acne sometimes become unavailable in certain
      countries, either for economic reasons or for shortage of them in the pharmaceutical
      market. The purpose of this report is to review a series of drugs of topical and
      systemic use; some old and some new. The topical group includes agents such as
      sulfur, salicylic acid and the alpha-hydroxy acids, while the systemic group
      includes diaminodiphenylsulfone, clofazimine, ibuprofen and others. Some presumably
      useful physical methodologies and the recent findings in phototherapy, particularly
      the properties of blue light and blue-red light, are also reviewed. Finally, we
      report on the results obtained from the combined use of isotretinoin and
      methylprednisone in severe inflammatory acne, to prevent a possible triggering of
      the 'pseudo' acne fulminans.

TI  - Acne phototherapy with a high-intensity, enhanced, narrow-band, blue light source:
      an open study and in vitro investigation.
PG  - 129-35
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of phototherapy with a
      newly-developed high-intensity, enhanced, narrow-band, blue light source in patients
      with mild to moderate acne. An open study was performed in acne patients who were
      treated twice a week up to 5 weeks. Acne lesions were reduced by 64%. Two patients
      experienced dryness. No patient discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. In
      vitro investigation revealed that irradiation from this light source reduced the
      number of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), but not Staphylococcus epidermidis
      that were isolated from the acne patients. Phototherapy using this blue light source
      was effective and well tolerated in acne patients and had an ability to decrease
      numbers of P. acnes in vitro, suggesting that this phototherapy may be a new
      modality for the treatment of acne.

TI  - Phototherapy with blue (415 nm) and red (660 nm) light in the treatment of acne
      vulgaris.
PG  - 973-8
AB  - In this study we have evaluated the use of blue light (peak at 415 nm) and a mixed
      blue and red light (peaks at 415 and 660 nm) in the treatment of acne vulgaris. One
      hundred and seven patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris were randomized into
      four treatment groups: blue light, mixed blue and red light, cool white light and 5%
      benzoyl peroxide cream. Subjects in the phototherapy groups used portable light
      sources and irradiation was carried out daily for 15 min. Comparative assessment
      between the three light sources was made in an observer-blinded fashion, but this
      could not be achieved for the use of benzoyl peroxide. Assessments were performed
      every 4 weeks. After 12 weeks of active treatment a mean improvement of 76% (95%
      confidence interval 66-87) in inflammatory lesions was achieved by the combined
      blue-red light phototherapy; this was significantly superior to that achieved by
      blue light (at weeks 4 and 8 but not week 12), benzoyl peroxide (at weeks 8 and 12)
      or white light (at each assessment). The final mean improvement in comedones by
      using blue-red light was 58% (95% confidence interval 45-71), again better than that
      achieved by the other active treatments used, although the differences did not reach
      significant levels. We have found that phototherapy with mixed blue-red light,
      probably by combining antibacterial and anti-inflammatory action, is an effective
      means of treating acne vulgaris of mild to moderate severity, with no significant
      short-term adverse effects.

      blue-light high-energy lamp].
PG  - 597-603
AB  - Lipophilic propionibacterium acnes stores large amounts of porphyrins. This
      peculiarity can be used for photodynamic destruction of propionibacteria. After
      repeated irradiations with a blue light-type high pressure lamp (Narva NC 1000-64)
      both acne and seborrhoea was improved markedly (10 irradiations, each for 10
      minutes, cumulative light dose 325 J/cm2). Also porphyrin content inside acne
      follicles dropped. Serial irradiations with short range visible light (400 to 420
      nm) are recommended for acne treatment during the light-poor season of the year.
