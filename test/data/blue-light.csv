CD015005.PUB2,"Ridley, B; Nonino, F; Baldin, E; Casetta, I; Iuliano, G; Filippini, G",Azathioprine for people with multiple sclerosis,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune‐mediated, chronic, inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, impacting around 2.8 million people worldwide. Characterised by recurrent relapses or progression, or both, it represents a substantial global health burden, affecting people, predominantly women, at a young age (the mean age of diagnosis is 32 years). Azathioprine is used to treat chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and it is used in clinical practice as an off‐label intervention for MS, especially where access to on‐label disease‐modifying treatments (DMTs) for MS is limited. Given this, a review of azathioprine's benefits and harms would be timely and valuable to inform shared healthcare decisions. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of azathioprine (AZA) for relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), compared to other disease‐modifying treatments (DMTs), placebo or no treatment. Specifically, we will assess the following comparisons. AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo as first‐choice treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo for relapsing forms of MS when switching from another DMT AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo as first‐choice treatment for progressive forms of MS AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo for progressive forms of MS when switching from another DMT Search methods We conducted an extensive search for relevant literature using standard Cochrane search methods. The most recent search date was 9 August 2023. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) lasting 12 months or more that compared azathioprine versus DMTs, placebo or no intervention in adults with MS. We considered evidence from non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) as these studies may provide additional evidence not available from RCTS. We excluded cluster‐randomised trials, cross‐over trials, interrupted time series, case reports and studies of within‐group design with no control group. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methodology. There were three outcomes we considered to be critical: disability, relapse and serious adverse events (SAEs, as defined in the studies). We were also interested in other important outcomes: quality‐of‐life (QoL) impairment (mental score), short‐term adverse events (gastrointestinal disorders), long‐term adverse events (neoplasms) and mortality. Main results We included 14 studies: eight RCTs (1076 participants included in meta‐analyses) and six NRSIs (1029 participants). These studies involved people with relapsing and progressive MS. Most studies included more women (57 to 83%) than men, with participants' average age at the onset of MS being between 29.4 and 33.4 years. Five RCTs and all six NRSIs were conducted in Europe (1793 participants); two RCTs were conducted in the USA (126 participants) and one in Iran (94 participants). The RCTs lasted two to three years, while NRSIs looked back up to 10 years. Four studies received some funding or support from commercial interests and five were funded by government or philanthropy; the other five provided no information about funding. There are three ongoing studies. Comparison groups included other DMTs (interferon beta and cyclosporine A), placebo or no treatment. Below, we report on azathioprine as a 'first choice' treatment compared to interferon beta for people with relapsing MS. None of the studies reported on any critical or important outcome for this comparison for progressive MS. No study was retrieved comparing azathioprine to placebo or other DMTs for either relapsing or progressive MS. Furthermore, the NRSIs did not provide information not already covered in the RCTs. Azathioprine as a first‐choice treatment compared to other DMTs (specifically, interferon beta) for relapsing MS ‐ The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of azathioprine on the number of people with disability progression over two years compared to interferon beta (risk ratio (RR) 0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.58; 1 RCT, 148 participants; very low certainty evidence). ‐ Azathioprine may decrease the number of people with relapses over a one‐ to two‐year follow‐up compared to interferon beta (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.86; 2 RCTs, 242 participants; low‐certainty evidence). ‐ Azathioprine may result in a possible increase in the number of people with SAEs over two years in comparison with interferon beta (RR 6.64, 95% CI 0.35 to 126.27; 1 RCT, 148 participants; low‐certainty evidence). ‐ The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of azathioprine on the number of people with the short‐term adverse event of gastrointestinal disorders over two years compared to interferon beta (RR 5.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 185.57; 2 RCTs, 242 participants; very low certainty evidence). We found no evidence comparing azathioprine to other DMTs for QoL impairment (mental score), long‐term adverse events (neoplasms) or mortality. Authors' conclusions Azathioprine has been proposed as an alternative treatment for MS when access to approved, on‐label DMTs is limited, especially in resource‐limited settings. The limited evidence available suggests that azathioprine may result in a modest benefit in terms of relapse frequency, with a possible increase in SAEs, when compared to interferon beta‐1b, for people with relapsing‐remitting multiple sclerosis. The evidence for the effect on disability progression and short‐term adverse events is very uncertain. Caution is required in interpreting the conclusions of this review since our certainty in the available evidence on the benefits and harms of azathioprine in multiple sclerosis is low to very low, implying that further evidence is likely to change our conclusions. An important limitation we noted in the available evidence is the lack of long‐term comparison with other treatments and the failure of most studies to measure outcomes that are important to people with multiple sclerosis, such as quality of life and cognitive decline. This is especially the case in the evidence relevant to people with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of azathioprine (a type of medication that affects the body's immune response) for people with multiple sclerosis? Key messages ‐ It is unclear if azathioprine (medication that affects the body's immune response) provides more benefits overall than other medicines for multiple sclerosis, like interferon (natural proteins made by the body to treat infection). Azathioprine may reduce the number of people experiencing relapses compared to interferon. ‐ People taking azathioprine over two years may be more likely to experience serious harmful effects than people taking interferon. ‐ Future studies should last longer than two years, focus on outcomes relevant for people with multiple sclerosis (quality of life, cognitive status) and include more people with progressive multiple sclerosis (whose symptoms gradually get worse). What is multiple sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis is a lifelong condition, affecting the brain and spinal cord. Its symptoms vary widely, can be mild or severe and include tiredness, pain, muscle cramps and reduction or loss of sensation and strength in parts of the body. Multiple sclerosis typically affects young people, mainly women, and people are often first diagnosed when aged between 20 and 40 years. The most common form of MS is relapsing‐remitting, where symptoms come ('relapse') and go ('remit'). 'Progressive' multiple sclerosis is when symptoms gradually get worse (i.e. there is no recovery or the body struggles to recover between relapses). How is multiple sclerosis treated? No treatment can cure multiple sclerosis, but many available medicines can reduce relapse frequency and slow disability progression. Azathioprine is a drug used in other diseases also caused by an impaired immune response. In countries where there are fewer treatments available, azathioprine is sometimes used to treat multiple sclerosis, even though it is not currently licensed for that purpose. A previous Cochrane Review found some evidence that azathioprine could be a possible treatment compared to interferon. What did we want to find out? We were interested in the benefits and harms of azathioprine, either as the first treatment choice ('first choice') or when other medicines did not work or were not wanted ('switching'), compared to other treatments. We were also interested in the effects of azathioprine compared to placebo (dummy tablet) or no treatment. What did we do? We searched for studies comparing azathioprine with other medicines, placebo or no treatment. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors like study methods and size. We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), where participants are assigned randomly to two or more groups. This way of conducting a study is the best way to reduce the impact of non‐treatment factors that could influence the results. We also looked at non‐randomised studies (NRS), meaning people were put in groups in a way that was not random or that the people chose which group they wanted to be in. What did we find? We found 14 studies (8 randomised trials and 6 NRS) that involved 2105 participants with relapsing‐remitting and progressive multiple sclerosis. Ten studies included more women with multiple sclerosis (57 to 83%) than men. The average age of onset of MS was between 29.4 and 33.4 years. The non‐randomised studies and five of the RCTs were conducted in Europe; two RCTs were conducted in the USA and one RCT was conducted in Iran. The RCTs lasted up to three years, while the NRS looked back up to 10 years. Four studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, five by governments or charities, and five did not report this information. Azathioprine as a 'first choice' treatment compared to other active treatments for relapsing multiple sclerosis Compared to interferon, over two years of treatment: ‐ azathioprine may reduce the number of people with relapses; ‐ people taking azathioprine may experience more serious harmful effects; ‐ azathioprine may increase nausea or vomiting (or both); and ‐ the effect of azathioprine on worsening disability or short‐term negative side effects is very uncertain. We found no evidence comparing azathioprine to other treatments for the outcomes of quality of life, mental health, cancer or numbers of deaths. We found no studies that looked at azathioprine as a 'first choice' treatment compared to other active treatments for progressive multiple sclerosis, or any studies that looked at azathioprine when 'switching' from other treatments, after they did not work or were not wanted, either for people with relapsing or progressive multiple sclerosis. The non‐randomised studies provided no additional information to that already provided by RCTs. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are not very confident in the evidence because: ‐ few studies, including relatively few people and very few events, are available; ‐ the quality of studies is not high; and ‐ the evidence does not cover all the comparisons we are interested in. How up to date is the evidence?

Other factors, such as recipient age and donor sex, may modify the association between sex/gender and post‐transplant outcomes. Objectives We sought to evaluate the prognostic effects of recipient sex and, separately, gender as independent predictors of graft loss, death, cancer, and allograft rejection following kidney or simultaneous pancreas‐kidney (SPK) transplantation. We aimed to evaluate this prognostic effect by defining the relationship between recipient sex or gender and post‐transplantation outcomes identifying reasons for variations between sexes and genders, and then quantifying the magnitude of this relationship. Search methods We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception up to 12 April 2023, through contact with the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Information Specialist, using search terms relevant to this review and no language restrictions. Selection criteria Cohort, case‐control, or cross‐sectional studies were included if sex or gender were the primary exposure and clearly defined. Studies needed to focus on our defined outcomes post‐transplantation. Sex was defined as the chromosomal, gonadal, and anatomical characteristics associated with the biological sex, and we used the terms “males” and “females”. Gender was defined as the attitudes and behaviours that a given culture associates with a person’s biological sex, and we used the terms “men” and “women”. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the references for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Whenever appropriate, we performed random‐effects meta‐analyses to estimate the mean difference in outcomes. The outcomes of interest included the Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology‐Kidney Transplant (SONG‐Tx) core outcomes, allograft loss, death, cancer (overall incidence and site‐specific) and acute or chronic graft rejection. Main results Fifty‐three studies (2,144,613 patients; range 59 to 407,963) conducted between 1990 and 2023 were included. Sixteen studies were conducted in the Americas, 12 in Europe, 11 in the Western Pacific, four in the Eastern Mediterranean, three in Africa, two in Southeast Asia, and five across multiple regions. All but one study focused on sex rather than gender as the primary exposure of interest. The number identified as male was 54%; 49 studies included kidney transplant recipients, and four studies included SPK transplant recipients. Twenty‐four studies included adults and children, 25 studies included only adults, and four studies included only children. Data from 33 studies were included in the meta‐analyses. Among these, six studies presented unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) that assessed the effect of recipient sex on kidney allograft loss. The other studies reported risk ratios (RRs) for the pre‐defined outcomes. Notably, the decision to restrict the meta‐analyses to unadjusted estimates arose from the variation in covariate adjustment methods across studies, lacking a common set of adjusted variables. Only three studies considered the modifying effect of recipient age on graft loss or death, which is likely crucial to evaluating sex differences in post‐transplant outcomes. No studies considered the modifying effect of recipient age on cancer incidence or allograft rejection risk. In low certainty evidence, compared with male recipients, being female may make little or no difference in kidney allograft loss post‐transplantation (7 studies, 5843 patients: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12; I 2  = 73%). This was also observed in studies that included time‐to‐event analyses (6 studies, 238,937 patients; HR 1.07, 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.20; I 2  = 44%). Two recent large registry‐based cohort studies that considered the modifying effects of donor sex and recipient age showed that female recipients under 45 years of age had significantly higher graft loss rates than age‐matched male recipients in the setting of a male donor. In contrast, female recipients 60 years and older had lower graft loss rates than age‐matched male recipients, regardless of donor sex. Compared with male recipients, being female may make little or no difference in death up to 30 years post‐transplantation; however, the evidence is very uncertain (13 studies, 60,818 patients: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.09; I 2  = 92%). Studies that considered the modifying effect of recipient age and donor sex showed that female recipients had a higher excess death risk than males under 45 years of age in the setting of a male donor. Compared with male recipients, being female may make little or no difference in cancer incidence up to 20 years post‐transplantation; however, the evidence is very uncertain (7 studies, 25,076 patients; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.01; I 2  = 60%). Compared with male recipients, being female may make little or no difference in the incidence of acute and chronic kidney allograft rejection up to 15 years post‐transplantation (9 studies, 6158 patients: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.05; I 2  =54%; low certainty evidence). One study assessed gender and reported that when compared with men, women experienced better five‐year survival in high (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.87) and middle‐income areas (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.92), with no difference in low‐income areas (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.01). There was considerable uncertainty regarding any association between sex or gender and post‐transplant patient‐relevant outcomes. This was primarily due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity. The observed clinical heterogeneity between studies could be attributed to diverse patient characteristics within sample populations. As a result of limited sex‐stratified demographic data being provided, further investigation of this heterogeneity was constrained. However, factors contributing to this finding may include recipient age, donor age, types, and sex. Methodological heterogeneity was noted with the interchangeable use of sex and gender, outcome misclassification, the use of different measures of effects, inconsistent covariate profiles, and disregard for important effect modification. Authors' conclusions There is very low to low certainty evidence to suggest there are no differences in kidney and pancreas allograft survival, patient survival, cancer, and acute and chronic allograft rejection between male and female kidney and SPK transplant recipients. Plain language summary What are the effects of sex and gender on outcomes after kidney transplantation? Key messages • There may be no differences in the loss of a transplanted kidney (a surgical procedure where a kidney is transferred from one person ‐ the donor ‐ to another person ‐ the recipient), death, acute or chronic rejection (the body's immune system attacking the transplanted kidney), or the incidence of cancer between male and female kidney transplant recipients (the definition of “male” or “female” based on biological differences). • Only one study investigated gender (defined as the sociocultural identity of individuals), and no conclusions could be made about the effect of gender on kidney transplant outcomes. What is the issue? For a person with kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive), kidney transplantation (a surgical procedure where a kidney is transferred from one person ‐ the donor ‐ to another person ‐ the recipient) significantly improves a person's survival and quality of life. As a result, it is essential that all factors that impact important outcomes, such as the survival of the transplanted kidney and the overall person's survival, are thoroughly assessed. Recipient sex, which is defined as “male” or “female” based on biological differences, may impact these outcomes through an immunological process affecting graft rejection. Gender, defined as the sociocultural identity of individuals, may influence factors such as medication adherence, which could also influence relevant outcomes. However, it is not clear currently if there is an impact. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if a person's sex or gender influences post‐transplant outcomes such as rejection of the kidney (caused by the body's immune system attacking the transplanted kidney), loss of the transplanted kidney, development of cancer, or death. What did we do? We searched the medical literature primarily for cohort studies (studies that follow people over a period of time), case‐control studies (studies comparing two groups of people with and without our specific outcomes) and cross‐sectional studies (data collected on many individuals at a single point in time) that focused on how sex and gender impact on graft survival, death, cancer incidence and rejection after kidney and simultaneous pancreas‐kidney transplantation. We did not include studies that did not define sex and gender clearly. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as study methods and size. What did we find? We found 53 studies with 2,940,273 patients, with the number ranging from 59 to 407,963, and of these, 46% were female and 54% male. Sixteen studies were conducted in the Americas, 12 in Europe, 11 in the Western Pacific, four in the Eastern Mediterranean, three in Africa, two in Southeast Asia and five across multiple regions. Compared to males, being female may make little or no difference to the loss of the transplanted kidney, death, those diagnosed with cancer, or the incidence of either acute or chronic rejection. We found only one study that focused on recipient gender and, therefore, cannot make any conclusions on the effect of gender on outcomes following kidney transplantation. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence is low because most studies did not define sex or gender separately, and the terms were often used interchangeably. Studies were conducted over a very wide time frame (from 1990 to 2023), and definitions, particularly for acute rejection, have changed over this 30‐year period. How up to date is this review?

CD015397.PUB2,"Littlecott, H; Krishnaratne, S; Hummel, J; Orban, E; Heinsohn, T; Noel-Storr, AH; Strahwald, B; Jung-Sievers, C; Ravens-Sieberer, U; Rehfuess, E",Unintended consequences of measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID‐19 pandemic: a scoping review,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Background Throughout the COVID‐19 pandemic, schools were a key setting for intervening with public health and social measures (PHSM) to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Consequently, there is a need to assess the varied unintended consequences associated with PHSM implemented in the school setting, for students, teachers, and school staff, as well as for families and the wider community. This is an update of a Cochrane scoping review first published in 2022. Objectives To comprehensively identify and summarise the published literature on the unintended consequences of public health and social measures implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. This will serve to identify critical knowledge gaps to inform future primary research and systematic reviews. It may also serve as a resource for future pandemic management. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Web of Science on 5 and 6 January 2023. We also searched two COVID‐19‐specific databases (Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease). Finally, we reviewed the included studies of all relevant systematic reviews and guidelines identified through the searches. Selection criteria We included studies that empirically assessed the impact of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. We imposed no restrictions with regard to the types of populations and specific interventions. Outcomes of interest were consequences that were measured or experienced, but not anticipated consequences. This review focused on real‐world evidence: empirical quantitative, qualitative, and mixed‐method studies were eligible for inclusion, but modelling studies were ineligible. Data collection and analysis The review was guided by a logic model. In line with the latest Cochrane effectiveness review of school measures to contain COVID‐19 and a conceptual framework of PHSM, this logic model distinguishes between measures to make contacts safer (related to individual protection and the physical environment), measures to reduce contacts (related to social interactions, movement, and services) and surveillance and response measures. Unintended consequences comprise the following categories: health and well‐being, health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, acceptability and adherence, equality and equity, social and institutional, economic and resource, and ecological. The review team screened all titles and abstracts, then potentially eligible full‐text articles, in duplicate. Across the included studies, we summarised and presented types of measures, consequences, and study designs using the predefined categories of the logic model, while allowing for emerging categories. Main results We included 60 studies (57 new to this update) from 25 countries. There were 31 quantitative studies, 17 qualitative studies, and 12 mixed‐method studies. Most targeted either students (26 studies), teachers and school staff (11 studies), or students and school staff (12 studies). Others evaluated measures aimed at parents (2 studies), staff and parents (1 study), students and teachers (3 studies), or the whole school (5 studies). The measures were related to individual protection (26 studies), the physical environment (20 studies), social interactions (25 studies), services (1 study), movement (3 studies), surveillance (9 studies) and response (7 studies). Nine studies evaluated the combined effect of multiple measures. The main consequences assessed were from the categories health and well‐being (29 studies), acceptability and adherence (31 studies), and social and institutional (23 studies). Fewer studies covered consequences from the categories equality and equity (2 studies), economic and resource (7 studies), and ecological (1 study). No studies examined consequences for the health system and social welfare services or for human and fundamental rights. Authors' conclusions This scoping review provides an overview of the evidence on the unintended consequences of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. The 60 included studies describe a broad body of evidence and cover a range of measures and unintended consequences, primarily consequences for health and well‐being, acceptability and adherence, social and institutional aspects, and economic aspects. The main gaps identified relate to consequences of school measures for the health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, equality and equity, and the environment. Further research is needed to fill these gaps, making use of diverse methodological approaches. Future studies should explore unintended consequences – whether beneficial or harmful – in more depth and over longer time periods, in different population groups, and across different contexts. A more robust evidence base could inform and facilitate decisions about whether, how, and when to implement or terminate COVID‐19 risk mitigation measures in school settings, and how to counter negative unintended consequences.

Registration The protocol is registered on the Open Science Framework (osf.io/bsxh8). The previous review is published in the Cochrane Library (10.1002/14651858.CD015397). Plain language summary What were the unintended consequences of school‐based measures to manage the COVID‐19 pandemic? Why is this question important? During the COVID‐19 pandemic, different measures were implemented in schools to help stop the virus spreading. These measures included changes to school rules or actions with the following goals. To reduce the spread of the virus when people were together To reduce the number of face‐to‐face contacts between people To test whether people had COVID‐19 To isolate those with COVID‐19 to prevent it spreading School measures like these can have both planned (intended) effects and unplanned (unintended) effects, which we need to monitor. For example, a rule to improve hand hygiene should lead to more handwashing (a planned effect) but could also lead to skin problems (an unplanned effect). These unplanned effects can be negative or positive, and can affect students, teachers, other school staff members, parents, and the wider community. What are school measures to help contain the COVID‐19 pandemic? We identified four types of school measures. Measures to make contacts safer. These work by reducing risk during face‐to‐face contact. Examples include mask wearing, ventilation, and hand hygiene. Measures to reduce the opportunity for contacts. These work by reducing face‐to‐face contact between students and others. One example is lowering the number of students in a classroom. Surveillance and response measures. These work by testing whether people have COVID‐19 and taking action to prevent it spreading, for example by isolating people who test positive. Multi‐component measures. These combine aspects of the above three types of measures. What did we want to find out? We aimed to find and describe evidence on the unplanned effects of school measures implemented to help contain the spread of COVID‐19. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at side effects of school measures. We grouped the side effects into the following categories. Physical and mental health and well‐being Health and social care services Human rights Acceptability of measures Unfair differences in health outcomes Civil life, social interactions, and education Money and resources The environment We summarised the available information on school measures and their side effects. What did we find? We included 60 studies from 25 countries. Regarding study design, 31 used numbers and statistics, 17 used text and descriptions, and 12 used both numbers and descriptions. Most studies looked at measures for staff (11 studies) or students (26 studies), or measures aimed at both staff and students or the whole school (20 studies). Only three studies looked at measures for parents or caregivers. The studies investigated the following measures in schools. Individual protection (26 studies); for example, wearing masks Changes to the physical environment (20 studies); for example, improving ventilation Rules about social interactions (25 studies); for example, mixing online and in‐person teaching Changes to services (1 study); for example, cancelling extracurricular activities Rules about movement (3 studies); for example, staying in class at break time Surveillance measures (9 studies); for example, testing students and teachers Response measures (7 studies); for example, isolating people with COVID‐19 Nine studies looked at the joint effects of more than one measure (for example, joint effects of wearing masks and improving ventilation). Most studies focused on the following unplanned effects. The influence of school measures on health and well‐being (29 studies) Whether school measures were acceptable or easy to carry out (31 studies) How school measures affected social interactions, school organisation, and education (23 studies) Other unplanned effects included the following. Changes to unfair differences in health outcomes (2 studies) Effects on money and resources (7 studies) Effects on the environment (1 study) What did we conclude? Most of the studies in the review looked at the influence of school measures on health and well‐being; social interactions, school organisation, and education; and whether measures were acceptable and easy to carry out. The most common school measures were wearing masks, cleaning and disinfecting rooms and surfaces, mixing online and in‐person learning, and ensuring physical distancing. Many studies also looked at combinations of several measures. This review identified the gaps, where more research is needed. We need more studies to look at a wider variety of unplanned effects. We also need more studies looking at the unplanned effects of other school measures, such as testing and response measures. Future studies should look at long‐term effects, too.

CD003200.PUB9,"Larun, L; Brurberg, KG; Odgaard-Jensen, J; Price, JR",Exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Background Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is a serious disorder characterised by persistent postexertional fatigue and substantial symptoms related to cognitive, immune and autonomous dysfunction. There is no specific diagnostic test, therefore diagnostic criteria are used to diagnose CFS. The prevalence of CFS varies by type of diagnostic criteria used. Existing treatment strategies primarily aim to relieve symptoms and improve function. One treatment option is exercise therapy. Objectives The objective of this review was to determine the effects of exercise therapy for adults with CFS compared with any other intervention or control on fatigue, adverse outcomes, pain, physical functioning, quality of life, mood disorders, sleep, self‐perceived changes in overall health, health service resources use and dropout. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group controlled trials register, CENTRAL, and SPORTDiscus up to May 2014, using a comprehensive list of free‐text terms for CFS and exercise. We located unpublished and ongoing studies through the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to May 2014. We screened reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field for additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) about adults with a primary diagnosis of CFS, from all diagnostic criteria, who were able to participate in exercise therapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessments and data extraction. We combined continuous measures of outcomes using mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). To facilitate interpretation of SMDs, we re‐expressed SMD estimates as MDs on more common measurement scales. We combined dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results We included eight RCTs with data from 1518 participants. Exercise therapy lasted from 12 weeks to 26 weeks. The studies measured effect at the end of the treatment and at long‐term follow‐up, after 50 weeks or 72 weeks. Seven studies used aerobic exercise therapies such as walking, swimming, cycling or dancing, provided at mixed levels in terms of intensity of the aerobic exercise from very low to quite rigorous, and one study used anaerobic exercise. Control groups consisted of passive control, including treatment as usual, relaxation or flexibility (eight studies); cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (two studies); cognitive therapy (one study); supportive listening (one study); pacing (one study); pharmacological treatment (one study) and combination treatment (one study). Most studies had a low risk of selection bias. All had a high risk of performance and detection bias. Exercise therapy compared with 'passive' control Exercise therapy probably reduces fatigue at end of treatment (SMD −0.66, 95% CI −1.01 to −0.31; 7 studies, 840 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence; re‐expressed MD −3.4, 95% CI −5.3 to −1.6; scale 0 to 33). We are uncertain if fatigue is reduced in the long term because the certainty of the evidence is very low (SMD −0.62, 95 % CI −1.32 to 0.07; 4 studies, 670 participants; re‐expressed MD −3.2, 95% CI −6.9 to 0.4; scale 0 to 33). We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions because the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.97; 1 study, 319 participants). Exercise therapy may moderately improve physical functioning at end of treatment, but the long‐term effect is uncertain because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Exercise therapy may also slightly improve sleep at end of treatment and at long term. The effect of exercise therapy on pain, quality of life and depression is uncertain because evidence is missing or of very low certainty. Exercise therapy compared with CBT Exercise therapy may make little or no difference to fatigue at end of treatment (MD 0.20, 95% CI ‐1.49 to 1.89; 1 study, 298 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or at long‐term follow‐up (SMD 0.07, 95% CI −0.13 to 0.28; 2 studies, 351 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions because the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.96; 1 study, 321 participants). The available evidence suggests that there may be little or no difference between exercise therapy and CBT in physical functioning or sleep (low‐certainty evidence) and probably little or no difference in the effect on depression (moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain if exercise therapy compared to CBT improves quality of life or reduces pain because the evidence is of very low certainty. Exercise therapy compared with adaptive pacing Exercise therapy may slightly reduce fatigue at end of treatment (MD −2.00, 95% CI −3.57 to −0.43; scale 0 to 33; 1 study, 305 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and at long‐term follow‐up (MD −2.50, 95% CI −4.16 to −0.84; scale 0 to 33; 1 study, 307 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.97; 1 study, 319 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The available evidence suggests that exercise therapy may slightly improve physical functioning, depression and sleep compared to adaptive pacing (low‐certainty evidence). No studies reported quality of life or pain. Exercise therapy compared with antidepressants We are uncertain if exercise therapy, alone or in combination with antidepressants, reduces fatigue and depression more than antidepressant alone, as the certainty of the evidence is very low. The one included study did not report on adverse reactions, pain, physical functioning, quality of life, sleep or long‐term results. Authors' conclusions Exercise therapy probably has a positive effect on fatigue in adults with CFS compared to usual care or passive therapies. The evidence regarding adverse effects is uncertain. Due to limited evidence it is difficult to draw conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of CBT, adaptive pacing or other interventions. All studies were conducted with outpatients diagnosed with 1994 criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Oxford criteria, or both. Patients diagnosed using other criteria may experience different effects. Plain language summary Exercise as treatment for adults with chronic fatigue syndrome What is the aim of this review? People with chronic fatigue syndrome have long‐lasting fatigue, joint pain, headaches, sleep problems, poor concentration and short‐term memory. These symptoms cause significant disability and distress. We wanted to find out whether exercise therapy can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome (myalgic encephalomyelitis). Key messages People who have exercise therapy probably have less fatigue at the end of treatment than those who receive more passive therapies. We are uncertain if this improvement lasts in the long term. We are also uncertain about the risk of serious side effects from exercise therapy. What was studied in the review? We explored whether exercise therapy can reduce chronic fatigue syndrome symptoms. We searched for studies comparing the effect of exercise therapy with treatment as usual or other therapies. What are the main results of the review? We found eight studies with 1518 participants. The studies compared participants who received exercise therapy to participants who received treatment as usual or more active treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy. Participants had exercise therapy for 12 weeks to 26 weeks. The studies measured the effect of the therapy at the end of the treatment and also long term, after 50 or 72 weeks. Participants exercised at different levels of intensity using variations of aerobic exercising such as walking, swimming or cycling. Exercise therapy compared to treatment as usual or relaxation Participants who have exercise therapy probably have less fatigue at the end of treatment, and they may have moderately better physical functioning. We are uncertain if these improvements last long term because we are very uncertain about the evidence. Participants who have exercise therapy may have slightly better sleep, both at the end of treatment and long term. We are uncertain about the risk of serious side effects and the effects of exercise therapy on pain, quality of life, and depression. This is because we lack evidence or because we are very uncertain about the evidence. Exercise therapy compared to cognitive behavioural therapy Exercise therapy may make little or no difference to participants’ fatigue at end of treatment or in the long term. Exercise therapy may make little or no difference to participants’ physical functioning at end of treatment, but the long‐term effect on physical functioning is uncertain. No studies looked at the effect of exercise therapy on depression at the end of treatment, but it probably has little or no long‐term effect. We are uncertain about the risk of side effects. We are also uncertain about the effects on pain, quality of life, or sleep. This is because we lack evidence or because we are very uncertain about the evidence. Exercise therapy compared to adaptive pacing (living within limits) Participants who have exercise therapy may have slightly less fatigue and depressive symptoms and slightly better physical functioning and sleep at the end of treatment and long term than participants who have adaptive pacing. We are uncertain about the risk of serious side effects. We are also uncertain about the effect on quality of life or pain. This is because we lack evidence or we are very uncertain about the evidence. Exercise therapy compared to antidepressants We are uncertain if exercise therapy is better than antidepressants at reducing fatigue. We are also uncertain of its effect on depression, side effects, pain, physical functioning, quality of life or sleep. This is because we lack evidence or we are very uncertain about the evidence. Why is this review important? Exercise therapy is recommended by treatment guidelines and often used as treatment for people with chronic fatigue syndrome. People with chronic fatigue syndrome should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment based on robust research evidence and whether exercise therapy is effective, either as a stand‐alone intervention or as part of a treatment plan. It is important to note that the evidence in this review is from people diagnosed with 1994 criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Oxford criteria. People diagnosed using other criteria may experience different effects.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adult; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Depression [therapy]; Exercise; Exercise Therapy [adverse effects, *methods]; Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic [psychology, *therapy]; Health Status; Humans; Patient Dropouts [statistics & numerical data]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sleep Wake Disorders [therapy]",10.1002/14651858.CD003200.pub9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003200.pub9,Central Editorial Service

Self‐harm is increasingly common among young people in many countries, particularly among women and girls. The risk of suicide is elevated 30‐fold in the year following hospital presentation for self‐harm, and those with suicidal ideation have double the risk of suicide compared with the general population. Self‐harm and suicide in young people are significant public health issues that cause distress for young people, their peers, and family, and lead to substantial healthcare costs. Educational settings are widely acknowledged as a logical and appropriate place to provide prevention and treatment. A comprehensive, high‐quality systematic review of self‐harm and suicide prevention programmes in all education settings is thus urgently required. This will support evidence‐informed decision making to facilitate rational investment in prevention efforts in educational settings. Suicide and self‐harm are distressing, and we acknowledge that the content of this review is sensitive as the data outlined below represents the lived and living experience of suicidal distress for individuals and their caregivers. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions delivered in educational settings to prevent or address self‐harm and suicidal ideation in young people (up to the age of 25) and examine whether the relative effects on self‐harm and suicide are modified by education setting. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, CENTRAL, The C ochrane Database of Systematic Reviews , Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ERIC, Web of Science Social Science Citation Index, EBSCO host Australian Education Index, British Education Index, Educational Research Abstracts to 28 April 2023. Selection criteria We included trials where the primary aim was to evaluate an intervention specifically designed to reduce self‐harm or prevent suicide in an education setting. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, cross‐over trials and quasi‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Primary outcomes were self‐harm postintervention and acceptability; secondary outcomes included suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and two outcomes co‐designed with young people: better or more coping skills, and a safe environment, with more acceptance and understanding. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted random‐effects meta‐analyses and assessed certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. For co‐designed outcomes, we used vote counting based on the direction of effect, as there is a huge variation in the data and the effect measure used in the included studies. Main results We included 51 trials involving 36,414 participants (minimum 23; maximum 11,100). Twenty‐seven studies were conducted in secondary schools, one in middle school, one in primary school, 19 in universities, one in medical school, and one across education and community settings. Eighteen trials investigated  universal interventions , 11 of which provided data for at least one meta‐analysis, but no trials provided data for self‐harm postintervention. Evidence on the acceptability of universal interventions is of very low certainty, and indicates little or no difference between groups (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.67; 9 studies, 8528 participants). Low‐certainty evidence showed little to no effect on suicidal ideation (SMD −0.02, 95% CI −0.23 to 0.20; 4 studies, 379 participants) nor on hopelessness (MD −0.01, 95% CI −1.98 to 1.96; 1 trial, 121 participants). Fifteen trials investigated  selective interventions , eight of which provided data for at least one meta‐analysis, but only one trial provided data for self‐harm postintervention. Low‐certainty evidence indicates that selective interventions may reduce self‐harm postintervention slightly (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.43; 1 trial, 148 participants). While no trial provided data for hopelessness, little to no effect was found on acceptability (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.5 to 2.0; 6 studies, 10,208 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or suicidal ideation (SMD 0.04, 95% CI −0.36 to 0.43; 2 studies, 102 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Seventeen trials investigated  indicated interventions , 14 of which provided data for at least one meta‐analysis, but only four trials provided data for self‐harm postintervention and two reported no events in both groups. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that indicated interventions may slightly reduce self‐harm postintervention (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.76; 2 studies, 76 participants). There is also low‐certainty evidence indicating that these interventions may decrease the odds of non‐suicidal self‐injury (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.79; 2 studies, 89 participants). Evidence of a slight decrease in acceptability in the intervention group is of low certainty (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.42; 10 studies, 641 participants). Low‐certainty evidence shows that indicated interventions may slightly reduce suicidal ideation (SMD −0.33, 95% CI −0.55 to −0.10; 10 studies, 685 participants) and may result in little to no difference in hopelessness postintervention (SMD −0.27, 95% CI −0.55 to 0.01; 6 studies, 455 participants). There were mixed findings regarding the effect of suicide prevention interventions on a range of constructs relevant to coping skills and safe environment. None of the trials, however, measured the impact of improvements in these constructs on self‐harm or suicidal ideation. Authors' conclusions While this review provides an update on the evidence about interventions targeting self‐harm and suicide prevention in education settings, there remains significant uncertainty about the impact of these interventions. There are some promising findings but large replication studies are needed, as are studies that examine the combination of different intervention approaches, and can be delivered in a safe environment and implemented over a long period of time. Further research is required to understand and measure outcomes that are meaningful to young people with lived experience, as they want coping skills and safety of the environment in which they conduct their everyday lives to be measured as key outcomes in future trials. Plain language summary Are actions taken in schools, colleges and universities to prevent self‐harm and suicide in young people up to the age of 25 effective? Key messages • We found 51 studies to answer our question, but we remain uncertain about the impact of interventions in education settings to reduce self‐harm. • There are some encouraging findings, but we need large studies to confirm them, and studies that examine the combination of different intervention approaches that are co‐designed with young people, can be delivered in a safe environment and implemented over a long period of time. How are self‐harm and suicide prevented? Self‐harm and suicide in young people are significant public health issues that cause distress for young people, their friends and other young people they spend time with, and communities. Actions to prevent suicide and self‐harm address the factors that can be changed, including building strengths that protect young people. There are three main types of actions. 'Universal interventions' are typically aimed at increasing knowledge and skills about self‐harm and suicide prevention, like mental health or suicide awareness education programmes. Also, teaching specific skills that act as protective factors, like problem‐solving skills. This helps to decrease negative attitudes and shame, which then increases the likelihood that people will seek help if they are experiencing suicidal thoughts or are engaging in self‐harm. 'Selective interventions' ensure that those who are experiencing suicidal thinking or are engaging in self‐harm will be noticed and provided with support. This often includes training people (peers and adults) to recognise distress in others by asking questions and getting them engaged in appropriate support. 'Indicated interventions' tend to be targeted at individuals, such as talking therapies. They are typically provided in clinical settings. The way they work depends on the underlying approach of the intervention. The most common approaches are cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which includes helping people to recognise and challenge the unhelpful thinking that leads to distressing emotions and thoughts of suicide or self‐harm; and dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT), which focuses on reducing life‐threatening behaviours by increasing people’s abilities both to accept and to change, painful emotions and other responses. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if universal, selective and indicated interventions delivered in education settings reduced: • self‐harm; • suicidal Ideation (thinking about suicide); and • hopelessness. We also wanted to know if these interventions were acceptable to young people. We measured this by the number of people who did not complete the study (dropouts). We explored whether studies measured outcomes that young people thought were important, including coping skills, and aspects of an environment that make them safe. We searched for any kind of measurement of coping skills and safe environment. What did we do? We searched for studies that examined universal, selective and indicated interventions designed to reduce self‐harm or prevent suicide in any education setting. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods, sample sizes and other biases evident in the study procedures. What did we find? We found 51 studies with 36,414 young people. Twenty‐seven studies were conducted in secondary schools, one in middle school, one in primary school, 19 in universities, one in medical school, and one across education and community settings. None were conducted in alternative education or technical training school settings. Studies compared the interventions with no intervention, being on a waiting list, or other approaches, such as exercise or healthy eating. Overall, there was little evidence indicating the impact of universal, selective or indicated interventions for any outcomes. None of the studies on universal approaches provided data on self‐harm. It is not clear whether selective and indicated interventions may slightly reduce self‐harm compared to comparison groups. There might be a small reduction in non‐suicidal self‐injury (injuring yourself without any intention to die) for indicated interventions when compared to the comparison group. The evidence for the acceptability of the intervention showed that indicated participants might be more likely to drop out from indicated interventions when compared to control but showed no difference for universal or selective interventions. There might be a decrease in suicidal ideation and hopelessness for those who receive indicated interventions compared to control but probably little to no effect for universal and selective interventions. There was a wide range of measurement of coping skills and safe environments, but there was limited information to indicate any improvement. What are the limitations of the evidence? Young people in the trials were probably aware of what intervention they received and not all the studies provided data about self‐harm and other outcomes that we were interested in. There were few really large studies, which are important for understanding how interventions impact prevention. Unfortunately, our measurement of dropouts was not useful in the context of education settings, where it was often not clear whether young people had dropped out or were not at school that day.

CD013302.PUB2,"Aldin, A; Baumeister PhD, A; Chakraverty, D; Monsef, I; Noyes, J; Kalbe, E; Woopen, C; Skoetz, N",Gender differences in the context of interventions for improving health literacy in migrants: a qualitative evidence synthesis,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Background Health literacy can be defined as a person's knowledge, motivation and competence in four steps of health‐related information processing ‐ accessing, understanding, appraising and applying health‐related information. Individuals with experience of migration may encounter difficulties with or barriers to these steps that may, in turn, lead to poorer health outcomes than those of the general population. Moreover, women and men have different health challenges and needs and may respond differently to interventions aimed at improving health literacy. In this review, we use 'gender' rather than 'sex' to discuss differences between men and women because gender is a broad term referring to roles, identities, behaviours and relationships associated with being male or female. Objectives The overall objective of this qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) was to explore and explain probable gender differences in the health literacy of migrants. The findings of this QES can provide a comprehensive understanding of the role that any gender differences can play in the development, delivery and effectiveness of interventions for improving the health literacy of female and male migrants. This qualitative evidence synthesis had the following specific objectives: ‐ to explore whether there are any gender differences in the health literacy of migrants; ‐ to identify factors that may underlie any gender differences in the four steps of health information processing (access, understand, appraise, and apply); ‐ to explore and explain gender differences found ‐ or not found ‐ in the effectiveness of health literacy interventions assessed in the effectiveness review that is linked to this QES (Baumeister 2023); ‐ to explain ‐ through synthesising findings from Baumeister 2023 and this QES ‐ to what extent gender‐ and migration‐specific factors may play a role in the development and delivery of health literacy interventions. Search methods We conducted electronic searches in MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Embase until May 2021. We searched trial registries and conference proceedings. We conducted extensive handsearching and contacted study authors to identify all relevant studies. There were no restrictions in our search in terms of gender, ethnicity or geography. Selection criteria We included qualitative trial‐sibling studies directly associated with the interventions identified in the effectiveness review that we undertook in parallel with this QES. The studies involved adults who were first‐generation migrants (i.e. had a direct migration experience) and used qualitative methods for both data collection and analysis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data into a form that we developed specifically for this review. We assessed methodological limitations in the studies using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) Qualitative Studies) checklist. The data synthesis approach that we adopted was based on ""best fit"" framework synthesis. We used the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our level of confidence in each finding. We followed PRISMA‐E guidelines to report our findings regarding equity. Main results We included 27 qualitative trial‐sibling studies directly associated with 24 interventions assessed in a linked effectiveness review (Baumeister 2023), which we undertook in parallel with this QES. Eleven studies included only women, one included only men and 15 included both. Most studies were conducted in the USA or Canada and primarily included people of Latino/Latina and Hispanic origin. The second most common origin was Asian (e.g. Chinese, Korean, Punjabi). Some studies lacked information about participant recruitment and consideration of ethical aspects. Reflexivity was lacking: only one study contained a reflection on the relationship between the researcher and participants and its impact on the research. None of the studies addressed our primary objective. Only three studies provided findings on gender aspects; these studies were conducted with women only. Below, we present findings from these studies, with our level of confidence in the evidence added in brackets. Accessing health information We found that 'migrant women of Korean and Afghan origin preferred access to a female doctor' (moderate confidence) for personal reasons or due to cultural norms. Our second finding was that 'Afghan migrant women considered their husbands to be gatekeepers', as women of an Afghan background stressed that, in their culture, the men were the heads of the household and the decision‐makers, including in personal health matters that affected their wives (low confidence). Our third finding was 'Afghan migrant women reported limited English proficiency' (moderate confidence), which impeded their access to health information and services. Understanding health information Female migrants of Afghan background reported limited writing and reading abilities, which we termed 'Afghan migrant women reported low literacy levels' (moderate confidence). Applying health information Women of Afghan and Mexican backgrounds stated that the 'women's role in the community' (moderate confidence) prevented them from maintaining their own health and making themselves a priority; this impeded applying health information. Appraising health information We did not find any evidence related to this step in health information processing. Other findings In the full text of this QES, we report on migration‐specific factors in health literacy and additional aspects related to health literacy in general, as well as how participants assessed the effectiveness of health literacy interventions in our linked effectiveness review. Moreover, we synthesised qualitative data with findings of the linked effectiveness review to report on gender‐ and migration‐specific aspects that need to be taken into account in the development, design and delivery of health literacy interventions. Authors' conclusions The question of whether gender differences exist in the health literacy of migrants cannot be fully answered in this qualitative evidence synthesis. Gender‐specific findings were presented in only three of the 27 included studies. These findings represented only Afghan, Mexican and Korean women's views and were probably culturally‐specific. We were unable to explore male migrants' perceived health literacy due to the notable lack of research involving migrant men. Research on male migrants' perceived health literacy and their health‐related challenges is needed, as well as more research on potential gender roles and differences in the context of migration. Moreover, there is a need for more research in different countries and healthcare systems to create a more comprehensive picture of health literacy in the context of migration. Plain language summary Are there differences between migrant women and men in how they access, understand, appraise and apply health information? Key messages ‐ A full exploration of whether differences exist between migrant women and men in how they access, understand, appraise and apply health information was not possible, particularly due to there being very little research with migrant men. ‐ Three studies conducted with migrant women indicated that particular gender roles in different communities and cultures can influence how health information is accessed, understood and applied. What did we want to find out? Our primary goal was to find out whether there are differences in how migrant (i.e. having moved to live in a foreign country) women and men access, understand, appraise and apply health information. To help us understand the evidence, we used an approach called the 'best fit framework' and a model known as 'health literacy information processing'. The four steps of health information processing ‐ the ability to access, understand, appraise and apply health information ‐ are what we define as a person's 'health literacy'. What did we do? We were interested in qualitative studies (e.g. studies where people share their opinions and perspectives on a certain health topic through interviews or group discussions). We conducted another review alongside this one to find out the effectiveness of different interventions to improve the health literacy of migrant women and men. We then integrated the findings of that review with this one to explain to what extent gender‐ and migration‐specific factors may play a role in the development and delivery of health literacy interventions. For this qualitative review, we searched for qualitative studies that were directly related to the interventions in the linked effectiveness review. We were interested in studies that were conducted alongside the effectiveness studies. These were studies that explored the perceptions and opinions of people from different cultural backgrounds on a certain health topic to help develop an intervention, or explore their experiences with an intervention that they had participated in. We used the four steps of the health information processing model (described above) to guide our synthesis of these data. We also assessed the quality of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as adequacy and relevance. What did we find? We included 27 studies. Eleven studies included only women, one study included only men, and 15 studies included both women and men. The age of study participants ranged from 26 to 87 years. Most studies were conducted in the USA or Canada and primarily included people of Latino/Latina/Hispanic origin (e.g. from the Caribbean, Central America or South America). The second most common origin of people was Asian (e.g. Chinese, Korean, Punjabi). The length of time participants had been living in the new country ranged from one month up to 38 years. Three studies of migrant women provided evidence on aspects that were related to migrant women, some of which also indicated differences between women and men. Regarding accessing health information, migrant women of Afghan and Korean background in two studies preferred access to a female rather than a male doctor for personal reasons, such as feelings of shame or humiliation, or due to cultural norms. Another finding regarding access was the perception of husbands as gatekeepers; women of Afghan background mentioned that in their culture, men are the head of the household and decision‐maker in the household, including about personal health matters that affect the women. Our third finding about access was that Afghan women's limited English proficiency impeded their access to health information and services. Regarding understanding health information, we identified low literacy levels amongst Afghan women as they reported limited ability in writing and reading. We did not find any evidence about the third step of health information processing ‐ appraising health information. Regarding applying health information, women of Mexican and Afghan background stated that the role of women in the community prevented them from maintaining their own health and making themselves a priority; this impeded applying health information. What are the limitations of the evidence? We rated our confidence in the evidence as moderate. We had minor to very minor concerns regarding methodological limitations in the studies, but serious concerns regarding the adequacy of the evidence as the evidence on gender aspects stems from only three studies and those studies included women only. We were not able to explore migrant men's health literacy due to the lack of research involving men. We suggest that more research on male migrants' perceived health literacy and their health‐related challenges is needed, particularly to explore potential differences between women and men. Moreover, there is a need for more research in different countries and healthcare systems to create a more comprehensive picture of aspects of health literacy in the context of migration.

CD016120,"Dey, T; Brown, D; Cole, MG; Hill, RA; Chaplin, M; Huffstetler, HE; Curtis, F",Cell salvage for the management of postpartum haemorrhage,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Rationale Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), defined as a blood loss of 500 mL or more within 24 hours of birth, is the leading global cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Allogenic blood transfusions are a critical component of PPH management, yet are often unfeasible, particularly in resource‐poor settings where maternal morbidity is highest. Autologous cell salvage in the management of PPH has been proposed to combat limitations in access to allogenic blood and potential transfusion‐related risks. This review examines the benefits and harms of using cell salvage for pregnant women during birth. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of cell salvage when used during birth. Search methods We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Global Index Medicus databases and the ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers. We also carried out reference checking and citation searching, and contacted study authors to identify all relevant studies. The latest search date was 8 February 2024. Eligibility criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in pregnant women (24 weeks or more gestation) comparing use of cell salvage following caesarean or vaginal birth with routine care (defined as no cell salvage). We did not place any restrictions on mode of birth, ethnicity, race, socioeconomic status, education level, or place of residence. Outcomes Critical outcomes for this review were risk of allogenic blood transfusion, risk of transfusion‐related adverse reactions, risk of haemorrhage, transfer to higher level of care, length of hospitalisation, length of operation, and risk of sepsis. Important outcomes were estimated blood loss, blood loss ≥ 500 mL, blood loss ≥ 1000 mL, use of additional uterotonics or tranexamic acid, maternal death, postpartum haemoglobin concentration, change in haemoglobin, major surgery including hysterectomy, future major surgery, end‐organ dysfunction or failure, amniotic fluid embolism, side effects, clotting abnormalities, maternal experience/satisfaction, maternal well‐being, and breastfeeding. Risk of bias We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1) for each critical outcome from each RCT. Synthesis methods We conducted a meta‐analysis for each outcome where data were available from more than one study using a random‐effects model. If data could not be analysed using meta‐analysis, we synthesised results narratively using the Synthesis Without Meta‐analysis (SWiM) guidance. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Included studies We included six RCTs with 3476 participants. All trials involved pregnant women having a caesarean birth. Three trials were conducted in high‐income countries, and three were conducted in an upper‐middle‐income country. Synthesis of results Allogenic blood transfusion Intraoperative cell salvage at caesarean birth may reduce the need for allogenic transfusions received by participants, although the 95% confidence interval (CI) includes the possibility of an increase in effect. Low‐certainty evidence from three studies found the risk of donor transfusions was possibly lower in participants with cell salvage (risk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.33; P = 0.15, I 2  = 33%; 3 RCTs, 3115 women; low‐certainty evidence). The absolute risk of transfusion was very low in the studies (4% in women not treated with cell salvage and 2% in women treated with cell salvage). Transfusion‐related adverse reactions The evidence is very uncertain about the risk of transfusion‐related adverse reactions in participants with intraoperative cell salvage (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.62; P = 0.39; 4 RCTs, 3304 women; very low‐certainty evidence). Haemorrhage Two studies reported risk of haemorrhage and found that there was probably no difference between arms (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.15; P = 0.36, I² = 0%; 2 RCTs, 3077 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). Length of hospitalisation The evidence is very uncertain about whether interoperative cell salvage at caesarean birth affects length of hospitalisation. Three studies reported length of hospitalisation (MD ‐2.02 days, 95% CI ‐4.73 to 0.70; P = 0.15, I 2  = 100%; 3 RCTs, 3174 women; very low‐certainty evidence). Length of operation Two studies reported on length of operation. However, meta‐analysis was not possible due to statistical heterogeneity and divergence of study findings; the direction of effect could not be determined. We evaluated the evidence as very low certainty. Sepsis One study reported risk of sepsis, finding that there was possibly no difference between arms (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.29; P = 0.99; 1 RCT, 2990 women; low‐certainty evidence). Estimated blood loss Cell salvage at caesarean birth may reduce blood loss. Two studies reported that estimated blood loss was possibly lower in women who had cell salvage compared to those who did not (MD ‐113.59 mL, 95% CI ‐130.41 to ‐96.77; P < 0.00001, I 2  = 0%; 2 RCTs, 246 women; low‐certainty evidence). Postpartum haemoglobin concentration Cell salvage at caesarean birth may increase day one postpartum haemoglobin. Three studies reported day one postpartum haemoglobin levels (MD 6.14 g/L, 95% CI 1.62 to 10.65; P = 0.008, I 2  = 97%; 3 RCTs, 3070 women; low‐certainty evidence). Amniotic fluid embolism Three trials reported risk of amniotic fluid embolism and no cases were observed (n = 3226 women). Authors' conclusions Cell salvage may reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion, may reduce blood loss, and may increase day one postpartum haemoglobin in pregnant women having caesarean birth (low certainty). Cell salvage may make little to no difference to the risk of sepsis (low certainty) and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of haemorrhage (moderate certainty). The effect of cell salvage on risk of transfusion‐related adverse reactions is very uncertain. The effect of cell salvage on the length of hospital stay was both clinically and statistically heterogenous, with a very low certainty of evidence. The effect of cell salvage on length of operation is divergent and meta‐analysis was not possible due to significant statistical heterogeneity; the evidence is of very low certainty. No cases of amniotic fluid embolism were reported among the included trials. Studies in low‐ and middle‐income settings are needed. Funding This review had no dedicated funding. Registration This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024554204). Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of using cell salvage during birth? Key messages Use of cell salvage may reduce the need for additional blood transfusions, may reduce blood loss, and may increase postpartum haemoglobin on day one in women who have a caesarean birth. Cell salvage possibly makes little to no difference to the risk of sepsis and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of haemorrhage. We are not confident in the evidence regarding the effect of cell salvage on the risk of transfusion‐related adverse (unwanted or harmful) reactions, length of operation, and length of hospitalisation. What is postpartum haemorrhage? Postpartum haemorrhage is a blood loss of 500 mL or more within 24 hours of birth. It is the leading cause of maternal death and illness across the world. Postpartum haemorrhage causes a maternal death every seven minutes. Haemoglobin carries oxygen in the blood and haemoglobin levels can be used to diagnose postpartum haemorrhage. What did the authors want to find out? A part of postpartum haemorrhage management is the use of 'allogenic' blood transfusions. Allogenic blood transfusions use donated blood from other people. However, the supply of donor blood for transfusions is often scarce, especially in resource‐limited settings. Cell salvage is an intervention that allows clinical staff to collect any blood loss from birth, clean it, and use it for transfusion back to the mother. We wanted to find out, during birth, the benefits and harms of cell salvage compared to not using cell salvage. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared the use of cell salvage to routine care (defined as no cell salvage) in pregnant women during childbirth. The studies we looked at were those in which women were assigned randomly to treatment groups. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found six studies with 3476 women, who all had a caesarean birth. We found that the use of cell salvage may reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion, may reduce blood loss, and may increase postpartum haemoglobin on day one in pregnant women having a caesarean birth. Cell salvage may make little to no difference to the risk of sepsis (a response to an infection that damages vital organs and, often, causes death) and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of haemorrhage. We are not confident in the evidence for transfusion‐related adverse reactions, length of hospital stay, and duration of operation in pregnant women following a caesarean birth. What are the limitations of the evidence? Overall, our confidence in the results is limited. We are moderately confident in the evidence for one of the critical outcomes (risk of haemorrhage). We have little confidence in the evidence for two critical outcomes (risk of allogenic transfusions, risk of sepsis). We are not confident in the evidence for risk of transfusion‐related adverse reactions, length of hospitalisation, and length of operation .  No studies reported the need for transfer to higher level care. Further studies are needed on the use of cell salvage in women having a vaginal birth and in low‐ and middle‐income settings.

Training varies in exercise type (pelvic floor muscles contracting with and without other muscles), dose, and delivery (e.g. amount and type of supervision). Objectives To assess the effects of alternative approaches (exercise type, dose, and delivery) to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) in the management of urinary incontinence (stress, urgency, and mixed) in women. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (searched 27 September 2023; which contains CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and World Health Organization ICTRP), handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and reviewed reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised, quasi‐randomised, or cluster‐randomised trials in female stress, urge, or mixed urinary incontinence where one trial arm included PFMT and another was an alternative approach to PFMT type, dose, or intervention delivery. We excluded studies with participants with neurological conditions or pregnant or recently postpartum. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and methodological quality using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We extracted and cross‐checked data and resolved disagreements by discussion. Data processing was as described in the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions  (Version 6). Synthesis was completed in intervention subgroups. Main results This is a review update. The analysis included 63 trials with 4920 women; the previous version included 21 trials with 1490 women. Samples sizes ranged from 11 to 362. Overall, study participants were mid‐age (45 to 65 years) parous women with stress or stress‐predominant mixed urinary incontinence (46 trials), who had no prior incontinence treatment or pelvic surgery, or appreciable pelvic floor dysfunction. Trials were conducted in countries around the world, mostly in middle‐ or high‐income settings (53 trials). All trials had one or more arms using 'direct' PFMT, defined as repeated, isolated, voluntary pelvic floor muscle contractions. Trials were categorised as comparisons of exercise type (27 trials, 3 subgroups), dose (11 trials, 5 subgroups, 1 with no data), and delivery (25 trials, 5 subgroups). Incontinence quality of life data are reported here as the primary outcome. Adverse event data were summarised narratively. Comparison 1: exercise type Co‐ordinated training (body movements with concurrent pelvic floor muscle contraction) versus direct PFMT Co‐ordinated training may slightly improve quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.44 to −0.01; I 2  = 81%; 8 trials, 356 women; low‐certainty evidence). Indirect training (exercises that are not contractions of the pelvic floor muscles) versus direct PFMT Direct PFMT may moderately improve quality of life (SMD 0.70, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.02; I 2  = 78%; 4 trials, 170 women; low‐certainty evidence). Indirect training combined with direct PFMT versus direct PFMT Combining indirect training with direct PFMT may make little to no difference in quality of life (SMD −0.08, 95% CI −0.26 to 0.10; I 2  = 33; 7 trials, 482 women; low‐certainty evidence). Comparison 2: exercise dose PFMT with resistance device versus PFMT without resistance device PFMT without a resistance device may slightly improve incontinence quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD 0.22, 95% CI −0.04 to 0.48; I 2  = 32%; 3 trials, 227 women; very low‐certainty evidence). Maximal pelvic floor muscle contractions versus submaximal pelvic floor muscle contractions No data reported. PFMT more days per week versus PFMT fewer days per week PFMT more days per week may greatly improve incontinence quality of life (SMD −1.60, 95% CI −2.15 to −1.05; 1 trial, 68 women; low‐certainty evidence). PFMT in upright body positions versus PFMT when lying down No data reported. Comparison 3: exercise intervention delivery PFMT supervised in clinic versus PFMT at home Clinic supervision may slightly improve incontinence quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD −0.30, 95% CI −0.65 to 0.05; I 2  = 89%; 3 trials, 137 women; very low‐certainty evidence). More clinician contact for PFMT supervision versus less clinician contact No usable data reported. Individual supervision of PFMT versus group supervision Individually supervised PFMT probably results in little to no difference in quality of life (SMD −0.18, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.01; I 2  = 0%; 5 trials, 544 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). PFMT supervised in clinic versus supervision using e‐health (mobile app communication with clinicians) Clinic supervision may make little to no difference in incontinence quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD −0.11, 95% CI −0.41 to 0.19; 1 trial, 173 women; very low‐certainty evidence). PFMT instruction delivered via e‐health versus written instruction E‐health delivery may slightly improve quality of life (SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.43 to 0.01; I 2  = 25%; 3 studies, 318 women; low‐certainty evidence). Adverse events Nine trials collected adverse event data; 66/1083 (6%) women had an adverse event. Almost all events were associated with use of an intravaginal or intrarectal training device. The adverse events were vaginal discharge, spotting, or discomfort. Limitations in the evidence Four main factors influenced our certainty in the evidence: 44 trials were at unclear or high risk of selection bias; data were sparse in some subgroups with few trials, trials that did not measure outcomes of interest, or did not report usable data; results were inconsistent; and many trials were small (imprecise). Authors' conclusions Although there is low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence that some approaches to PFMT are better than others, for some there was little or no difference. The 7th International Consultation on Incontinence recommends PFMT as first‐line therapy for women with urinary incontinence. Direct PFMT (sets of repeated, isolated, voluntary pelvic floor muscle contractions) may result in a small improvement in incontinence quality of life compared to indirect training. In terms of improved quality of life, PFMT can be supervised individually or in a group because it probably makes little to no difference in achieving this outcome. Many comparisons had low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence, often because there was only one trial or several small trials with methodological limitations. More, better designed and reported trials, directly comparing PFMT approaches are needed, especially trials investigating exercise dose. Plain language summary Which approaches work best to treat involuntary urine leakage for women? Key messages – Some approaches for pelvic floor muscle (muscles supporting the bladder, bowel, and womb) training for women with involuntary (accidental) urine leakage are better than others, and some might be as good as each other. – We were unsure about many of the approaches, often because there was only one study or several small studies investigating the question. – More studies are needed that directly compare different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training, especially studies to find out whether different amounts (dose) of training are better than others — for example, exercising more or less often each week. What is urinary incontinence? The muscles of the pelvic floor form a sling between the legs from the pubic bone at the front of the pelvis to the tail bone at the back of the pelvis. This sling supports the bladder, bowel, and womb. If these muscles become weak, a woman may not be able to control the flow of urine (wee) from the bladder. This is called urinary incontinence. There are three main types of urinary incontinence. These are leakage with physical exertion (stress urinary incontinence), leakage with an urgent need to empty the bladder (urgency urinary incontinence), and both together (mixed urinary incontinence). This review covers all three types. Urinary incontinence seriously affects women's quality of life. What is pelvic floor muscle training? Improving the strength, endurance, and co‐ordination of the pelvic floor muscles by training them can decrease urine leakage. Training involves using different approaches (exercises) or different amounts (different doses) of the same approach. Supervision of training can be done differently too (for example, one clinician teaching one woman or one clinician teaching a group of women; or delivering the exercises by the internet, mobile phone, or in a leaflet). What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if: – one type of exercise was better than another; – higher exercise dose was better than lower exercise dose; – more‐intensive supervision was better than less‐intensive supervision of exercise. What did we do? We looked for studies that compared one type of exercise versus another, higher versus lower exercise dose, or more‐intensive versus less‐intensive supervision. The studies included women with urinary incontinence, but not women with conditions of the nervous system or women who were pregnant or had recently given birth. We compared and summarised the study results, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We were most interested in women's quality of life after treatment. What did we find? We found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. The biggest study included 362 women and the smallest 11 women. While the studies were conducted in countries around the world, most were from middle‐ to high‐income countries (meaning that women had reasonable access to good health care). Most studies lasted three months. Three studies had funding or non‐monetary support from a commercial company. Main results We were mainly interested in women's quality of life. This was measured using questionnaires about how often the incontinence happened, how much urine leaked, and how much it affected or limited the women. 1. Type of exercise – Combined training (e.g. using bridging exercises at the same time as pelvic floor muscle contraction) may be slightly better than pelvic floor muscle training alone. – Pelvic floor muscle training may be better than indirect training (exercises that do not include contractions of the pelvic floor muscles). ‐ Pelvic floor muscle training combined with indirect training may make little to no difference compared to pelvic floor muscle training alone. 2. Exercise dose – There was not enough evidence to comment on dose. 3. More‐intensive versus less‐intensive supervision – There is probably little or no difference between one‐to‐one supervision and group classes. – Delivering training instructions via technology (e.g. internet, mobile phone app) may be slightly better than leaflets. – There was not enough evidence to comment on other methods of training delivery. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are confident that there is little to no difference between one‐to‐one supervision and group classes. We are less confident that combining indirect training with pelvic floor muscle training compared to pelvic floor muscle training only makes little to no difference, and delivering pelvic floor muscle training instructions via technology is slightly better than the leaflets, or that pelvic floor muscle training is better than indirect training. Our confidence in the evidence for other comparisons of approaches to these exercises is low to very low, and the results of further research could differ from the results of this review. We were unsure about the evidence as study methods were not well described, not all the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in or they did not report it in a way we could use, results were inconsistent across different studies, and many studies were very small.

CD010861.PUB3,"Jensen, MCH; Holm, C; Jørgensen, KJ; Schroll, JB",Treatment for women with postpartum iron deficiency anaemia,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Rationale Postpartum iron deficiency anaemia is caused by antenatal iron deficiency or excessive blood loss at delivery and might affect up to 50% of labouring women in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Effective and safe treatment during early motherhood is important for maternal well‐being and newborn care. Treatment options include oral iron supplementation, intravenous iron, erythropoietin, and red blood cell transfusion. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of the available treatment modalities for women with postpartum iron deficiency anaemia. These include intravenous iron, oral iron supplementation, red blood cell transfusion, and erythropoietin. Search methods A Cochrane Information Specialist searched for all published, unpublished, and ongoing trials, without language or publication status restrictions. We searched databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify eligible studies. We applied date limits to retrieve new records since the last search on 9 April 2015 until 11 April 2024. Eligibility criteria We included published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatments for postpartum iron deficiency anaemia with placebo, no treatment, or alternative treatments. Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. We included RCTs regardless of blinding. Participants were women with postpartum haemoglobin ≤ 12 g/dL, treated within six weeks after childbirth. We excluded non‐randomised, quasi‐randomised, and cross‐over trials. Outcomes The critical outcomes of this review were maternal mortality and fatigue. The important outcomes included persistent anaemia symptoms, persistent postpartum anaemia, psychological well‐being, infections, compliance with treatment, breastfeeding, length of hospital stay, serious adverse events, anaphylaxis or evidence of hypersensitivity, flushing/Fishbane reaction, injection discomfort/reaction, constipation, gastrointestinal pain, number of red blood cell transfusions, and haemoglobin levels. Risk of bias We assessed risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. Synthesis methods Two review authors independently performed study screening, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction. We contacted trial authors for supplementary data when necessary. We screened all trials for trustworthiness and scientific integrity using the Cochrane Trustworthiness Screening Tool. We conducted meta‐analyses using a fixed‐effect model whenever feasible to synthesise outcomes. In cases where data were not suitable for meta‐analysis, we provided a narrative summary of important findings. We evaluated the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Included studies We included 33 RCTs with a total of 4558 postpartum women. Most trials were at high risk of bias for several risk of bias domains. Synthesis of results Most of the evidence was of low or very low certainty. Imprecision due to few events and risk of bias due to lack of blinding were the most important factors. Intravenous iron versus oral iron supplementation The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of intravenous iron on mortality (risk ratio (RR) 2.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 71.96; P = 0.51; I² = not applicable; 3 RCTs; 1 event; 572 women; very low‐certainty evidence). One woman died of cardiomyopathy, and another developed arrhythmia, both in the groups treated with intravenous iron. Intravenous iron probably results in a slight reduction in fatigue within 8 to 28 days (standardised mean difference −0.25, 95% CI −0.42 to −0.07; P = 0.006; I² = 47%; 2 RCTs; 515 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). Breastfeeding was not reported. Oral iron probably increases the risk of constipation compared to intravenous iron (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.21; P < 0.001; I² = 0%; 10 RCTs; 1798 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of intravenous iron on anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity (RR 2.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 24.86; P = 0.36; I² = 0%; 12 RCTs; 2195 women; very low‐certainty evidence). Three women treated with intravenous iron experienced anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity. The trials that reported on haemoglobin at 8 to 28 days were too heterogeneous to pool. However, 5 of 6 RCTs favoured intravenous iron, with mean changes in haemoglobin ranging from 0.73 to 2.10 g/dL (low‐certainty evidence). Red blood cell transfusion versus intravenous iron No women died in the only trial that reported on mortality (1 RCT; 7 women; very low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of red blood cell transfusion on fatigue at 8 to 28 days (mean difference (MD) 1.20, 95% CI −2.41 to 4.81; P = 0.51; I² = not applicable; 1 RCT; 13 women; very low‐certainty evidence) and breastfeeding more than six weeks postpartum (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.57; P = 0.20; I² = not applicable; 1 RCT; 13 women; very low‐certainty evidence). Constipation and anaphylaxis were not reported. Red blood cell transfusion may result in little to no difference in haemoglobin within 8 to 28 days (MD −1.00, 95% CI −2.02 to 0.02; P = 0.05; I² = not applicable; 1 RCT; 12 women; low‐certainty evidence). Intravenous iron and oral iron supplementation versus oral iron supplementation Mortality and breastfeeding were not reported. One trial reported a greater improvement in fatigue in the intravenous and oral iron group, but the effect size could not be calculated (1 RCT; 128 women; very low‐certainty evidence). Intravenous iron and oral iron may result in a reduction in constipation compared to oral iron alone (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.69; P = 0.01; I² = not applicable; 1 RCT; 128 women; low‐certainty evidence). There were no anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity events in the trials (2 RCTs; 168 women; very low‐certainty evidence). Intravenous iron and oral iron may result in little to no difference in haemoglobin (g/dL) at 8 to 28 days (MD 0.00, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.48; P = 1.00; I² = not applicable; 1 RCT; 60 women; low‐certainty evidence). Red blood cell transfusion versus no transfusion Mortality, fatigue at day 8 to 28, constipation, anaphylaxis, and haemoglobin were not reported. Red blood cell transfusion may result in little to no difference in breastfeeding more than six weeks postpartum (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.07; P = 0.24; I² = not applicable; 1 RCT; 297 women; low‐certainty evidence). Oral iron supplementation versus placebo or no treatment Mortality, fatigue, breastfeeding, constipation, anaphylaxis, and haemoglobin were not reported. Two trials reported on gastrointestinal symptoms, but did not report results by study arm. Authors' conclusions Intravenous iron probably reduces fatigue slightly in the early postpartum weeks (8 to 28 days) compared to oral iron tablets, but probably results in little to no difference after four weeks. It is very uncertain if intravenous iron has an effect on mortality and anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity. Breastfeeding was not reported. Intravenous iron may increase haemoglobin slightly more than iron tablets, but the data were too heterogeneous to pool. However, changes in haemoglobin levels are a surrogate outcome, and treatment decisions should preferentially be based on patient‐relevant outcomes. Iron tablets probably result in a large increase in constipation compared to intravenous iron. The effect of red blood cell transfusion compared to intravenous iron on mortality, fatigue, and breastfeeding is very uncertain. No studies reported on constipation or anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity. Red blood cell transfusion may result in little to no difference in haemoglobin at 8 to 28 days. The effect of intravenous iron and oral iron supplementation on mortality, fatigue, breastfeeding, and anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity is very uncertain or unreported. Intravenous iron and oral iron may result in a reduction in constipation compared to oral iron alone, and in little to no difference in haemoglobin. The effect of red blood cell transfusion compared to non‐transfusion on mortality, fatigue, constipation, anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity, and haemoglobin is unreported. Red blood cell transfusion may result in little to no difference in breastfeeding. The effect of oral iron supplementation on mortality, fatigue, breastfeeding, constipation, anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity, and haemoglobin is unreported.

Key messages Intravenous (given through a vein) iron probably reduces tiredness slightly at 8 to 28 days compared to oral (by mouth) iron supplements, but we are uncertain if intravenous iron and oral iron supplements compared to oral iron supplements alone affects tiredness at 8 to 28 days. We are very uncertain about the effect of red blood cell transfusion compared to intravenous iron on tiredness at 8 to 28 days, and there was no information on red blood cell transfusion compared to no transfusion on tiredness at 8 to 28 days. Death of the mother was either not reported, or the evidence was very uncertain for all comparisons. For oral iron compared to placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment, there was no information on tiredness at 8 to 28 days. What is iron deficiency anaemia? Anaemia is a condition where the blood contains less than normal haemoglobin (low blood count), as shown in blood tests. Haemoglobin is the molecule within red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Haemoglobin is a protein that consists of peptides and iron. Insufficient iron intake, problems with absorption of iron in the gut, or iron loss (bleeding) can cause iron deficiency anaemia. Symptoms of anaemia include tiredness, shortness of breath, dizziness, and difficulty getting breastfeeding started. Women may bleed severely at childbirth, and many pregnant women already have low iron stores or anaemia, or both, which can worsen as a result of bleeding. Severe anaemia has been linked to death of the mother after childbirth. Iron deficiency anaemia after childbirth is more likely to occur in low‐income countries. How is postpartum iron deficiency anaemia treated? Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia includes oral iron supplements or intravenous iron. Studies have found a risk of serious allergic reactions with intravenous iron. Another option is to restore red blood cells through transfusion with blood from a blood donor. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know if one treatment was better than another in relieving anaemia symptoms, and whether the treatment options were safe. What did we do? We searched medical databases for studies looking at available treatments for women with anaemia after childbirth. We screened studies for trustworthiness and included studies we considered trustworthy. The most important outcomes were fatigue (tiredness) and death. What did we find? We included 33 studies with a total of 4558 women and performed seven treatment comparisons. Eighteen trials (3026 women) compared intravenous iron with oral iron supplements. It is unclear if intravenous iron affects the number of deaths. Only one woman died, and she had received intravenous iron. Based on two studies (515 women), we found that intravenous iron probably reduces fatigue slightly within 8 to 28 days compared to oral iron supplements. No studies examined whether intravenous iron affects breastfeeding. Constipation was probably more frequent in women treated with oral iron supplements than in those receiving intravenous iron (10.7% versus < 1%). It is unclear if intravenous iron has an effect on allergic reactions (anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) or hypersensitivity occurred in three women who received intravenous iron). Intravenous iron may increase haemoglobin levels, but important differences among the studies prevented an estimate of the exact effect. Two studies compared red blood cell transfusions with intravenous iron. It is unclear if red blood cell transfusion affects the number of deaths, fatigue at 8 to 28 days, and breastfeeding. No studies looked at if intravenous iron affects constipation or allergic reactions. Red blood cell transfusion may result in little to no difference in haemoglobin. Three studies compared intravenous iron and oral iron supplements to oral iron supplementation alone. No studies looked at if intravenous iron and oral iron supplements affects the number of deaths or breastfeeding. It is unclear if intravenous iron and oral iron supplements affects allergic reactions or fatigue. Intravenous iron and oral iron supplementation may reduce constipation compared to oral iron alone (1 study; 128 women) and may result in little to no difference in haemoglobin levels at 8 to 28 days. One study compared red blood cell transfusions to no transfusions. No studies looked at if red blood cell transfusions affect the number of deaths, fatigue, constipation, allergic reactions, or haemoglobin levels. Red blood cell transfusion may result in little to no difference in breastfeeding beyond six weeks postpartum (1 study; 297 women). Three studies compared oral iron supplements to placebo. No studies looked at if oral iron supplements affect the number of deaths, fatigue, breastfeeding, allergic reactions, or haemoglobin levels within 8 to 28 days. Two studies reported on constipation not for both groups. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have low to very low confidence in the evidence because the women in the studies knew which treatment they received, which could have influenced the results. Also, few studies reported on outcomes that are important to patients. Only 8 of 33 included studies reported on fatigue. How up‐to‐date is this evidence?

CD014040.PUB2,"Kamath, MS; Vogiatzi, P; Sunkara, SK; Woodward, B",Oocyte activation for women following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI),Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Background Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a type of assisted reproductive technology (ART), is offered as a treatment option for male factor infertility. Over the years, the indications for ICSI have been expanded, despite uncertainty about its benefits and harms compared to the conventional method of achieving fertilisation. Artificial oocyte activation (AOA), which can be performed by chemical, electrical or mechanical intervention, has been employed during ART ICSI treatment where there has been a history of low fertilization rate or total fertilization failure, and it has been reported to improve reproductive outcomes. It is important to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of AOA in women undergoing ART ICSI treatment. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of artificial oocyte activation in women affected by infertility undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO international Clinical Trials Registry Platform (8 August 2024). We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials comparing artificial oocyte activation (AOA) (chemical, electrical or mechanical interventions) versus no intervention, placebo or another method of AOA in women undergoing ART. Data collection and analysis We used methodological procedures as per Cochrane recommendations. We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using ROB 2. The primary outcomes were live birth and miscarriage rates. We analyzed data using the risk ratio (RR) and a fixed‐effect model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence by using GRADE criteria. We restricted the primary analyses to studies at low risk of bias. Main results We included a total of 20 studies, four of which were participant‐based randomized trials with 743 participants. The remaining 16 were sibling‐oocyte‐model randomized studies. We based the main clinical findings of the current review on the participant‐based RCTs, and we restricted our primary analysis to studies with a low risk of bias. Based on the one trial with 343 participants that we included in our primary analysis, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of AOA on the live birth rate when compared to conventional ICSI without AOA in women undergoing ART ICSI (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.01; one trial; 343 participants). For a typical clinic with a live birth rate of 18% following ART, the addition of AOA may result in live birth rates between 24% and 55%, but this evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of AOA on the miscarriage rate compared to conventional ICSI without AOA in women undergoing ART ICSI (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.04; one trial; 343 participants). If the miscarriage rate was 9% following ART, addition of oocyte activation may result in miscarriage rates between 4% and 18%, but this evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of AOA on the clinical pregnancy rate compared to conventional ICSI without AOA in women undergoing ART ICSI (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.32; one trial; 343 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of AOA on the multiple pregnancy rate per participant compared to conventional ICSI without AOA in women undergoing ART ICSI (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.48 to 7.67; one trial; 343 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of AOA on the total fertilization failure rate compared to conventional ICSI without AOA in women undergoing ART ICSI (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.40; one trial; 343 participants). When we stratified our analysis according to various infertility factors, we found low‐certainty evidence that in couples undergoing ICSI treatment who have had a history of low or no fertilization, AOA may help improve the live birth rate while making little or no difference to the miscarriage rate. Further research is needed to confirm or refute this finding. None of the trials reported congenital anomalies (birth defects) as an outcome. Lack of short‐ or long‐term safety data is an important limitation of the review and of the trials in this field. We did not find any trials that compared two different methods of oocyte activation. Authors' conclusions We are uncertain about the effect of AOA on the live birth and miscarriage rates in women undergoing ART ICSI. In the subpopulation of those who have had a previous history of low or no fertilization, AOA may result in an increase in the live birth rate when compared to conventional ICSI without AOA, while making little or no difference to the miscarriage rate. There was considerable variation in the protocols used for chemical AOA, which affects the generalizability of the findings. Due to the very low to low certainty of evidence, the results should be interpreted with caution. Plain language summary Does performing an additional step of artificial oocyte activation improve the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment (ICSI) in women undergoing assisted reproduction? Key messages We are uncertain about the effect of artificial oocyte activation on the live birth rate and miscarriage rate amongst women with a mix of reasons for undergoing ICSI treatment. In couples undergoing ICSI treatment who have a history of low or no fertilization, performing artificial oocyte activation may help improve the live birth rate while making little or no difference to the miscarriage rate. More research is needed to explore these findings before we will be able to reach reliable conclusions about the benefits and risks of artIficial oocyte activation as part of intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment. What is artificial oocyte activation? ICSI is the injection of sperm directly into the human egg (oocyte) to obtain fertilization (union of egg and sperm). Artificial oocyte activation is an extra step in ICSI treatment. It involves the human egg into which a sperm has been injected being exposed to an environment rich in calcium to improve the fertilization rate. An improved fertilization rate following artificial oocyte activation may help achieve a higher success rate for women undergoing ICSI to get pregnant. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out the benefits and risks of performing the additional step of artificial oocyte activation in women undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment, compared to routine ICSI. We also wanted to find out whether one method of artificial oocyte activation is better than another method. What did we do? The review involved searching for studies that assessed the usefulness of artificial oocyte activation against the standard treatment in women undergoing ICSI. We planned to pool the results from high‐quality studies and evaluate our level of certainty about the evidence. What did we find? We found 20 studies in total, 16 of which studied the oocytes and reported laboratory measures (which we present in the full review). We found four studies that randomised women to an oocyte activation group or a no activation group. We present below the results from the only study of the four that we judged to be high quality. This high‐quality study included 343 participants who were undergoing ICSI. The study assessed artificial oocyte activation in couples with a previous history of low or no fertilization or where the male had abnormal sperm. Main results We do not know whether oocyte activation has an effect on live birth and miscarriage rates when compared to no oocyte activation in women undergoing ICSI treatment. It is also unclear if oocyte activation has an effect on clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy or total fertilization rates when compared to no oocyte activation in women undergoing ICSI treatment. When we looked separately at different infertility factors, we found that in couples undergoing ICSI treatment who have had a history of low or no fertilization, it is possible that oocyte activation may help improve the live birth rate while making little or no difference to the miscarriage rate. Further research is needed to test if this is a reliable finding. We did not find any studies of women undergoing ICSI treatment that compared one method of oocyte activation versus another method. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have low to very low certainty about our findings. More studies are needed to explore the potential benefits and harms of artificial oocyte activation in women undergoing ICSI. None of the studies reported birth defects as an outcome. Lack of short‐ or long‐term safety data is an important limitation of the review and of the studies in this area. How up to date is this evidence?

CD013725.PUB2,"Naeem, F; McCleery, J; Hietamies, TM; Abakar Ismail, F; Clinton, S; O'Mahony, A; Ponce, OJ; Quinn, TJ",Diagnostic test accuracy of self‐administered cognitive assessment tools for dementia,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Background Dementia is a chronic and progressive clinical syndrome that can present with a range of cognitive and behavioural symptoms. Global prevalence is projected to increase due to ageing populations, particularly in resource‐limited settings, with significant associated health and social care costs. There is a critical need for accurate cognitive assessment as part of the diagnostic workup for dementia. Although self‐administered cognitive assessment tools are not diagnostic, they can be used to assess cognition. The role of these tests is uncertain, and their diagnostic test accuracy remains unclear, but they may be useful tools in circumstances where face‐to‐face assessment may be difficult. Objectives Primary objective To assess the test accuracy of any self‐administered cognitive assessment tool for the diagnosis of any form of dementia in any setting, including community and secondary health care. Secondary objectives To identify: the quality and quantity of the research evidence describing test accuracy of self‐administered testing; sources of heterogeneity in the test accuracy described; and gaps in the evidence where further research is required. Search methods We searched MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid), Web of Science ‐ BIOSIS Citation Index, PsycINFO (Ovid), LILACS (BIREME), and CINAHL (EBSCO). The most recent searches were run on 2 November 2022. Selection criteria We included cross‐sectional studies investigating the accuracy of a self‐administered cognitive assessment tool. We included all settings, including community and secondary health care. The target condition of interest was a clinical diagnosis of dementia, therefore, we included only studies where the index test was administered alongside a reference standard clinical assessment. Our population of interest was any adult (over 18 years of age). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed included studies, assessed risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool, and extracted data. We obtained information on study design and participant characteristics, setting of index test, details of index text, reference standard used, and results reported as sensitivity and specificity. We performed a meta‐analysis on three studies that used the same threshold score. Main results The review included 11 eligible studies, with a total of 2303 participants, which evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of six different self‐administered cognitive‐assessment tools. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America, and South Korea within a variety of community and healthcare settings. Our quality assessment found that four studies had a low risk of bias across all domains. Six studies had a high or unclear risk of bias due to patient selection, with concerns around lack of a clear sampling strategy or exclusion criteria, or both. Six studies had a high or unclear risk of bias with regard to the index test due to lack of information about how the test was conducted and evaluated. For the diagnosis of dementia, sensitivity of self‐administered cognitive assessment tools ranged from 55% to 100% and specificity ranged from 45% to 100%. Three studies described the diagnostic test accuracy of Test Your Memory at a threshold of 42/50. Quantitative meta‐analysis estimated a summary point with 94% sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI) 90% to 96%) and 66% specificity (95% CI 45% to 82%) at this threshold. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any single self‐administered cognitive assessment tool. The tools had test accuracy scores that are similar to the range seen with standard pencil and paper cognitive screening tests conducted by clinicians. Further research on the optimal test and threshold score, and how that may be impacted by setting, language, and educational level is needed. Plain language summary How accurate are cognitive assessment tools, that are completed by people themselves, at detecting dementia? Key messages ‐ The evidence suggests that cognitive assessment tools that are completed by people themselves could be used in the detection and diagnosis of dementia. ‐ There is not enough evidence to recommend one type of assessment tool over another. ‐ Further research on the use of these assessment tools in different settings, such as clinics or people's homes, and the scores that indicate dementia is needed. Why is improving the detection of dementia important? The number of people diagnosed with dementia is expected to increase significantly in the future because global populations are living longer. This will have significant healthcare and social costs. Dementia is a permanent condition where memory deteriorates until people need assistance with their day‐to‐day activities. Accurate and quick diagnosis allows people with dementia and their families to access treatment and support. Failure to recognise the condition when it is present (a false‐negative test result) may lead to a delay in accessing treatments to help with memory, thinking, and behaviours, and accessing support from social services, such as social work and occupational therapy. An incorrect diagnosis of dementia (a false‐positive test) may be emotionally and psychologically distressing for people and their families. Currently, diagnosis of dementia involves a face‐to‐face assessment at a specialised clinic, where the medical history, a physical examination, blood tests, and brain scans are considered. What is a self‐administered cognitive assessment tool? Self‐administered cognitive assessment tools are tests completed by people themselves. They are designed to assess different aspects of mental capacity (i.e. cognition) including memory, language, and perception. The tools may involve questions to answer or tasks to complete. These self‐administered tools would not replace the detailed clinical assessment required for a diagnosis of dementia, but they could be useful in situations where face‐to‐face assessment might be difficult, such as during global pandemics, or in areas with few medical services. There are a number of different cognitive assessment tools; these vary in their content, scoring systems, and format (electronic or written). What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out how accurate cognitive assessment tools that can be completed by people themselves are at detecting dementia. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated the accuracy of self‐administered cognitive assessment tools for dementia in adults (over the age of 18 years) in any healthcare setting. What did we find? We found 11 studies with a total of 2303 participants that tested six different tools. Five studies looked at one test called 'Test Your Memory'; this was tested in five different languages. Two studies looked at the 'Self‐Administered Gerocognitive Examination'; one study tested a written version of the test and the other tested an electronic version. One study looked at each of the following cognitive assessment tools individually: the 'Clock Completion Test', 'Korean Dementia Screening Questionnaire‐Cognition', 'BrainCheck Memory', and 'MyMemCheck'. These tools all have different scoring systems and some studies looked at multiple cut‐off scores ‐ to indicate whether or not the person had dementia ‐ within each tool. Studies took place across Europe, the USA, and South Korea. The healthcare settings included community centres, nursing homes, and hospital clinics, and some studies included multiple settings. The average age of the people taking the tests varied amongst studies from 50 to 60 years to 80 to 90 years. We found that these cognitive assessment tools could correctly identify people with dementia between 55% and 100% of the time, and could correctly rule out dementia between 45% and 100% of the time. These ranges are due to differences in study populations, settings, type of assessment tool, and diagnostic cut‐off scores (i.e. score at which dementia was diagnosed). We summarised results from three studies that used 'Test Your Memory' and found that using a cut‐off score of 42/50, the assessment tool could correctly identify people with dementia around 94% of the time and correctly rule out dementia around 66% of the time. How reliable are the results of this review? In the studies we found, the tools' diagnosis of whether a person had dementia was confirmed by a traditional, face‐to‐face clinical assessment for dementia. There were some problems with the methods used in some studies, including the way participants were selected for the studies, and the timings and details of the clinical assessments were not always clear. Some studies had small numbers of participants. The test accuracy results are a summary based on evidence from the studies we examined. The results produced from individual studies varied considerably, so we cannot be sure these cognitive assessment tools will always produce the same results in clinical practice.

CD015424.PUB2,"MacLellan, A; Cameron-Nola, AJ; Cooper, C; Mitra, S",Fluid restriction for treatment of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Background The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel connecting the main pulmonary artery and the proximal descending aorta. After birth, the ductus arteriosus usually closes completely. However, sometimes it remains patent in the neonate, which is called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). If a PDA is clinically symptomatic, it can lead to overcirculation in the lungs, and reduced perfusion to the gut and kidneys. Most clinical practice guidelines suggest fluid restriction as a conservative management strategy for the treatment of symptomatic PDA. Restricting fluid has been shown to reduce the incidence of PDA in older preterm infants. However, aggressive restriction of fluids may affect systemic blood flow in extremely preterm infants. Given the potential adverse effects, it is important to systematically evaluate the evidence on the use of fluid restriction to treat symptomatic PDA to inform clinical decisions. Objectives To assess the effects of fluid restriction on morbidity and mortality for symptomatic PDA in preterm infants. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in October 2023. We also searched Clinicaltrials.gov, ICTRP, ANZCTR, and Epistemonikos. We planned to search the reference list of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for studies not identified by the database searches, but did not identify any. Selection criteria We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs, and cross‐over RCTs. We planned to include neonates who were born preterm (less than 37 weeks' gestational age), or with low birth weight (less than 2500 g), with a symptomatic PDA, diagnosed either clinically or by echocardiographic criteria, in the neonatal period. We planned to include studies that compared therapeutic restriction of parenteral or enteral fluids, or both, with or without diuretics, with control groups that received standard fluid intake, defined as no parenteral or enteral restriction, with or without diuretic use. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was closure of PDA. Other relevant outcomes were all‐cause mortality by 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, need for interventional closure of the PDA, need for treatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, and duration of hospitalization. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results We did not identify any completed or ongoing RCTs that met our inclusion criteria and explored the effectiveness and safety of fluid restriction to treat symptomatic PDA. Authors' conclusions No evidence from RCTs is currently available to evaluate the benefits and harms of fluid restriction for the treatment of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants. We identified no ongoing studies. Evidence from sufficiently powered RCTs evaluating fluid restriction for treatment of symptomatic PDA in preterm neonates is needed to inform clinical decisions. Plain language summary What are the advantages and disadvantages of restricting fluids in babies who are born premature and with a patent ductus arteriosus? Key Messages: There is no evidence for or against reducing fluids as a treatment option for patent ductus arteriosus in premature babies. We need randomized controlled trials that answer our question to help inform clinical decisions. What is patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)? The ductus arteriosus is an extra blood vessel that runs between the heart and lungs in babies before birth and just after. In order for the heart and lungs to work properly after birth, this blood vessel must close. In most babies, it closes naturally in a few days, and they are fine. However, in some premature babies (babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy), the ductus arteriosus stays open (which is called patent). This means extra blood may flow into the lungs and cause problems (symptomatic). This condition is called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). PDA may be treated by reducing the amount of fluids given to these babies. We are not sure of the benefits and risks of giving a premature baby less fluid to reduce the problems associated with PDA. What does restricting fluids mean? Fluid restriction means limiting the amount of nutritional or medicinal fluids given to babies who are unable to breastfeed or bottle‐feed. When babies are unable to take anything by mouth, their nutrition and medicine are given either through their veins (parenteral nutrition) or through a tube into their stomach (enteral nutrition). Limiting the amount of this fluid is one treatment used for babies with PDA. Experts believe that limiting liquids may help by potentially changing how the heart pumps blood around the body, and by reducing the effort needed for the heart to pump blood. However, it may also be risky to restrict liquid intake. One risk is that the baby may not get enough nutrition. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if restricting fluids helped to reduce sickness or death in babies with PDA. We wanted to find evidence that would help doctors decide whether to restrict fluid feeding or not, but we did not find any studies. What did we do? We searched for studies that assessed reducing fluid feeding, either by a tube into the stomach, or by a needle into a vein, in babies with PDA. What did we find? We did not find any randomized control trials (a trial in which participants are assigned to different study groups by chance) that assessed this treatment in premature babies with PDA. What are the limitations of the evidence? We did not find any evidence from randomized control trials. How up to date is this evidence?

G.; Van den Bruel, A",The effect of sample site and collection procedure on identification of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Background Sample collection is a key driver of accuracy in the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Viral load may vary at different anatomical sampling sites and accuracy may be compromised by difficulties obtaining specimens and the expertise of the person taking the sample. It is important to optimise sampling accuracy within cost, safety and accessibility constraints. Objectives To compare the sensitivity of different sampling collection sites and methods for the detection of current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with any molecular or antigen‐based test. Search methods Electronic searches of the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) were undertaken on 22 February 2022. We included independent evaluations from national reference laboratories, FIND and the Diagnostics Global Health website. We did not apply language restrictions. Selection criteria We included studies of symptomatic or asymptomatic people with suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection undergoing testing. We included studies of any design that compared results from different sample types (anatomical location, operator, collection device) collected from the same participant within a 24‐hour period. Data collection and analysis Within a sample pair, we defined a reference sample and an index sample collected from the same participant within the same clinical encounter (within 24 hours). Where the sample comparison was different anatomical sites, the reference standard was defined as a nasopharyngeal or combined naso/oropharyngeal sample collected into the same sample container and the index sample as the alternative anatomical site. Where the sample comparison was concerned with differences in the sample collection method from the same site, we defined the reference sample as that closest to standard practice for that sample type. Where the sample pair comparison was concerned with differences in personnel collecting the sample, the more skilled or experienced operator was considered the reference sample. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS‐2 and QUADAS‐C checklists, tailored to this review. We present estimates of the difference in the sensitivity (reference sample (%) minus index sample sensitivity (%)) in a pair and as an average across studies for each index sampling method using forest plots and tables. We examined heterogeneity between studies according to population (age, symptom status) and index sample (time post‐symptom onset, operator expertise, use of transport medium) characteristics. Main results This review includes 106 studies reporting 154 evaluations and 60,523 sample pair comparisons, of which 11,045 had SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Ninety evaluations were of saliva samples, 37 nasal, seven oropharyngeal, six gargle, six oral and four combined nasal/oropharyngeal samples. Four evaluations were of the effect of operator expertise on the accuracy of three different sample types. The majority of included evaluations (146) used molecular tests, of which 140 used RT‐PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Eight evaluations were of nasal samples used with Ag‐RDTs (rapid antigen tests). The majority of studies were conducted in Europe (35/106, 33%) or the USA (27%) and conducted in dedicated COVID‐19 testing clinics or in ambulatory hospital settings (53%). Targeted screening or contact tracing accounted for only 4% of evaluations. Where reported, the majority of evaluations were of adults (91/154, 59%), 28 (18%) were in mixed populations with only seven (4%) in children. The median prevalence of confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 was 23% (interquartile (IQR) 13%‐40%). Risk of bias and applicability assessment were hampered by poor reporting in 77% and 65% of included studies, respectively. Risk of bias was low across all domains in only 3% of evaluations due to inappropriate inclusion or exclusion criteria, unclear recruitment, lack of blinding, nonrandomised sampling order or differences in testing kit within a sample pair. Sixty‐eight percent of evaluation cohorts were judged as being at high or unclear applicability concern either due to inflation of the prevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in study populations by selectively including individuals with confirmed PCR‐positive samples or because there was insufficient detail to allow replication of sample collection. When used with RT‐PCR • There was no evidence of a difference in sensitivity between gargle and nasopharyngeal samples (on average ‐1 percentage points, 95% CI ‐5 to +2, based on 6 evaluations, 2138 sample pairs, of which 389 had SARS‐CoV‐2). • There was no evidence of a difference in sensitivity between saliva collection from the deep throat and nasopharyngeal samples (on average +10 percentage points, 95% CI ‐1 to +21, based on 2192 sample pairs, of which 730 had SARS‐CoV‐2). • There was evidence that saliva collection using spitting, drooling or salivating was on average ‐12 percentage points less sensitive (95% CI ‐16 to ‐8, based on 27,253 sample pairs, of which 4636 had SARS‐CoV‐2) compared to nasopharyngeal samples. We did not find any evidence of a difference in the sensitivity of saliva collected using spitting, drooling or salivating (sensitivity difference: range from ‐13 percentage points (spit) to –21 percentage points (salivate)). • Nasal samples (anterior and mid‐turbinate collection combined) were, on average, 12 percentage points less sensitive compared to nasopharyngeal samples (95% CI ‐17 to ‐7), based on 9291 sample pairs, of which 1485 had SARS‐CoV‐2. We did not find any evidence of a difference in sensitivity between nasal samples collected from the mid‐turbinates (3942 sample pairs) or from the anterior nares (8272 sample pairs). • There was evidence that oropharyngeal samples were, on average, 17 percentage points less sensitive than nasopharyngeal samples (95% CI ‐29 to ‐5), based on seven evaluations, 2522 sample pairs, of which 511 had SARS‐CoV‐2. A much smaller volume of evidence was available for combined nasal/oropharyngeal samples and oral samples. Age, symptom status and use of transport media do not appear to affect the sensitivity of saliva samples and nasal samples. When used with Ag‐RDTs • There was no evidence of a difference in sensitivity between nasal samples compared to nasopharyngeal samples (sensitivity, on average, 0 percentage points ‐0.2 to +0.2, based on 3688 sample pairs, of which 535 had SARS‐CoV‐2). Authors' conclusions When used with RT‐PCR, there is no evidence for a difference in sensitivity of self‐collected gargle or deep‐throat saliva samples compared to nasopharyngeal samples collected by healthcare workers when used with RT‐PCR. Use of these alternative, self‐collected sample types has the potential to reduce cost and discomfort and improve the safety of sampling by reducing risk of transmission from aerosol spread which occurs as a result of coughing and gagging during the nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal sample collection procedure. This may, in turn, improve access to and uptake of testing. Other types of saliva, nasal, oral and oropharyngeal samples are, on average, less sensitive compared to healthcare worker‐collected nasopharyngeal samples, and it is unlikely that sensitivities of this magnitude would be acceptable for confirmation of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with RT‐PCR. When used with Ag‐RDTs, there is no evidence of a difference in sensitivity between nasal samples and healthcare worker‐collected nasopharyngeal samples for detecting SARS‐CoV‐2. The implications of this for self‐testing are unclear as evaluations did not report whether nasal samples were self‐collected or collected by healthcare workers. Further research is needed in asymptomatic individuals, children and in Ag‐RDTs, and to investigate the effect of operator expertise on accuracy. Quality assessment of the evidence base underpinning these conclusions was restricted by poor reporting. There is a need for further high‐quality studies, adhering to reporting standards for test accuracy studies.

Key messages • When used with RT‐PCR tests (a molecular test that detects genetic material in COVID‐19 using a technique called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), self‐collected gargle and deep throat saliva samples have a similar sensitivity compared to trained healthcare worker‐collected nasopharyngeal samples (taken from the back of the throat through the nose) in detecting COVID‐19. • When used with RT‐PCR, samples collected from the nose, oropharynx (throat via the mouth), oral cavity, and other saliva collection methods are less sensitive for detecting COVID‐19 compared to healthcare worker‐collected nasopharyngeal samples. • When used with rapid antigen tests (Ag‐RDTs; at‐home/self‐tests), samples collected from the nose have a similar sensitivity to healthcare worker‐collected nasopharyngeal samples in detecting COVID‐19. Why is improving the diagnosis of COVID‐19 important? Coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) is caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). People with suspected COVID‐19 may decide to take a test to know whether they are infected, so that they can receive treatment, and follow recommended guidance to self‐isolate and inform close contacts. Not detecting COVID‐19 when it is present (a false negative result) risks spreading infection and results in missed opportunities for treatment. Types of sample collection methods for diagnosing COVID‐19? The type and quality of sample taken for confirmation of COVID‐19 affects the reliability of diagnosis. The most accurate type of sample to diagnose COVID‐19 is that taken by a trained healthcare worker from the back of the throat through the nose (a nasopharyngeal sample). This type of test detects genetic material in the virus using a technique called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). However, this sample is difficult to obtain correctly, causes discomfort and risks spreading infection if individuals cough or sneeze when the sample is taken. Alternative sample types, particularly those that can be self‐collected using rapid antigen tests (Ag‐RDTs; i.e. self‐tests), may reduce cost and discomfort and improve the safety of sampling. This may, in turn, improve access to and uptake of testing. What did we want to find out? We wanted to compare the sensitivity of different sample sites and collection methods in detecting COVID‐19 with molecular tests (RT‐PCR tests) or self‐based tests (Ag‐RDT tests). What did we do? We searched for studies that had compared the accuracy of nasopharyngeal samples to any alternative that could be used in patients outside of hospital, including nose (nasal) samples, throat samples taken through the mouth (oropharyngeal), gargle samples and saliva samples. We looked at the use of samples with either RT‐PCR or Ag‐RDTs. We also searched for studies that had compared different methods for taking samples, such as samples collected by a healthcare worker compared to those collected by individuals with no or minimal instructions. What did we find? The review included 106 studies with a total of 60,523 participants, of whom 11,045 had COVID‐19 infection. Fifty‐nine per cent of studies were conducted on adults and 79% on symptomatic or mixed symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Sixty per cent of studies took place in Europe or the USA; just over half (55%) took place in dedicated COVID‐19 testing centres or in outpatient settings. Main results With RT‐PCR, on average: ‐ 100% of positive nasopharyngeal samples collected by healthcare workers would also test positive on self‐collected gargle samples or saliva samples (collected by coughing and then spitting (deep throat saliva)); ‐ 88% of positive nasopharyngeal samples collected by healthcare workers would also test positive with self‐ or healthcare worker‐collected nose samples; ‐ 87% of positive nasopharyngeal samples collected by healthcare workers would also be detected by saliva self‐collected using spitting, 84% by saliva self‐collected using drooling and 79% by saliva self‐collected by sucking on a swab; and ‐ 83% of positive nasopharyngeal samples collected by healthcare workers would also be detected by self‐ or healthcare worker‐collected oropharyngeal samples. With Ag‐RDTs, on average: ‐ 100% of positive nasopharyngeal samples collected by healthcare workers would also be detected by self‐collected or healthcare worker‐collected nose samples. Summary results The results of these studies indicate that in a group of 1000 people, of whom 230 (23%) have COVID‐19, then: when used with PCR, compared to healthcare worker‐collected nasopharyngeal samples: ‐ no cases of COVID‐19 would be missed using self‐collected gargle samples (12 less to 5 more) or deep throat saliva samples (2 less to 48 more); ‐ 28 (16 to 39) fewer cases of COVID‐19 infection would be detected using healthcare worker‐ or self‐collected nose sample; ‐ 30 (18 to 41) fewer cases of COVID‐19 infection would be detected by saliva self‐collected using spitting, 37 (12 to 62) fewer by saliva collected by drooling and 48 (12 to 85) fewer by saliva collected by sucking on a swab; ‐ 39 (12 to 67) fewer cases of COVID‐19 infection would be detected by healthcare worker‐ or self‐collected oropharyngeal samples; and when used with Ag‐RDTs, compared to healthcare worker‐collected nasopharyngeal samples: no cases of COVID‐19 infection would be missed using healthcare worker‐ or self‐collected nose samples. What are the limitations of the evidence? It was often not clear whether included studies deliberately excluded inadequate samples or whether the results of the more accurate nasopharyngeal sample were known when alternative samples were interpreted. This may have resulted in alternative sample types appearing more accurate than they are in practice, decreasing the number of missed cases of COVID‐19 infection. More than half of studies did not give information about how long participants had had symptoms at the time of sampling. This reduces our confidence in the comparison of different sample types. Most studies evaluated self‐collected samples by adults with symptoms for use with RT‐PCR; therefore, the findings of this review may not be applicable to asymptomatic individuals or children. For studies conducted with Ag‐RDTs, it is unclear whether sensitivity estimates of nose samples are applicable to home use (self‐collected and self‐interpreted). How up to date is this review?

Therapeutic hypothermia is an effective treatment, but alternative therapies such as acupuncture are also used. Objectives To determine the benefits and harms of acupuncture (e.g. needle acupuncture with or without electrical stimulation; laser acupuncture; non‐penetrating types of manual or embedded acupressure) on mortality and morbidity in neonates with HIE, compared with 1) no treatment, 2) placebo or sham treatment, 3) any pharmacologic treatment, or 4) different types of acupuncture. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP in March 2023. We conducted a search of the grey literature to identify reports of trials conducted by or referenced in research by CORDIS EU, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and NHSGGC Paediatrics for Health Professionals. We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs and cluster‐randomized trials. We included studies where participants were term infants (37 weeks or greater) and late preterm infants (34 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks' gestation) 10 days of age or less, with evidence of peripartum asphyxia. We included studies on acupuncture (e.g. needle acupuncture with or without electrical stimulation; laser acupuncture; non‐penetrating types of manual or embedded acupressure). We included studies where acupuncture was compared with: 1) no treatment; 2) placebo or sham treatment; 3) any pharmacologic treatment; or 4) different types of acupuncture. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality at the latest follow‐up, major neurodevelopmental disability in children aged 18 to 24 months and aged 3 to 5 years, adverse events until hospital discharge, and length of hospital stay. Main results We included four studies (enrolling 464 infants) that compared acupuncture with no treatment. The studies ranged in size from 60 to 200 infants. Three studies were conducted in China and one in Russia. None of the four studies reported on any of the prespecified outcomes of our review. We did not identify any ongoing studies. Authors' conclusions There is limited availability of studies addressing this specific population. The included studies did not assess mortality, long‐term neurodevelopmental outcomes, or adverse effects of acupuncture. We are unable to draw any conclusions about the benefits and harms of acupuncture for HIE in neonates. In light of the current limitations, clinicians are urged to approach the use of acupuncture in neonates with HIE cautiously, as there is no evidence to support its routine application. The available trials assessed surrogate outcomes that have a relatively small impact on newborns, and failed to report important outcomes such as mortality and long‐term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Other available trials were performed on older infants who had experienced neonatal HIE. Given the lack of available evidence, well‐designed randomized controlled trials with relevant outcomes such as mortality and neurodevelopmental outcomes are essential to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for HIE in neonates. Plain language summary What are the benefits and harms of acupuncture for babies with lack of oxygen at birth (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy)? Key messages • We are unable to draw any conclusions about the benefits and harms of acupuncture for babies with lack of oxygen at birth (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy) due to lack of evidence. • There is a need for future studies looking at the benefits and harms of acupuncture, also compared to medicines, or comparing different ways of using acupuncture. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and acupuncture Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy occurs in babies when they lack oxygen in the period around birth and can result in serious disease and death. Effective treatment options are limited. However, cooling down the body temperature for three days has been shown to be beneficial. Acupuncture has also been tried in babies with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Acupuncture is a treatment used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Needles (or lasers) are used at specific (pressure) points in the body. It is believed that the acupuncture points can alter the flow of energy or life force in the body and bring it back into balance in order to prevent illness or disease. It consists of different types, such as needle acupuncture with or without electrical stimulation, laser acupuncture, and non‐penetrating types of manual acupressure where fingers instead of needles are used. Moreover, the duration and frequency of acupuncture may vary. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of acupuncture in babies with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Our primary outcomes were death, long‐term brain development in children aged 18 to 24 months and aged 3 to 5 years, unwanted events, and length of hospital stay. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared acupuncture to no treatment, placebo or sham treatment (fake or pretend treatment given to participants in a scientific study), any medicines, or other types of acupuncture (e.g. acupuncture with needles compared to laser acupuncture). What did we find? We found four studies that included 464 babies with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The studies ranged in size from 60 to 200 babies. Three studies were conducted in China and one in Russia. Main results None of the four studies reported any of the outcomes of interest in our review. We are unable to draw any conclusions about the benefits and harms of acupuncture for babies with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy due to lack of evidence. We did not identify any ongoing studies.

CD011677.PUB4,"Lee, DCW; O'Brien, KM; McCrabb, S; Wolfenden, L; Tzelepis, F; Barnes, C; Yoong, S; Bartlem, KM; Hodder, RK","Strategies for enhancing the implementation of school‐based policies or practices targeting diet, physical activity, obesity, tobacco or alcohol use",Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Background A range of school‐based interventions are effective in improving student diet and physical activity (e.g. school food policy interventions and classroom physical activity interventions), and reducing obesity, tobacco use and/or alcohol use (e.g. tobacco control programmes and alcohol education programmes). However, schools are frequently unsuccessful in implementing such evidence‐based interventions. Objectives The primary review objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies aiming to improve school implementation of interventions to address students' (aged 5 to 18 years) diet, physical activity, obesity, tobacco use and/or alcohol use. The secondary objectives are to: 1. determine whether the effects are different based on the characteristics of the intervention including school type and the health behaviour or risk factor targeted by the intervention; 2. describe any unintended consequences and adverse effects of strategies on schools, school staff or students; and 3. describe the cost or cost‐effectiveness of strategies. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), five additional databases, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the US National Institutes of Health registry (clinicaltrials.gov). The latest search was between 1 May 2021 and 30 June 2023 to identify any relevant trials published since the last published review. Selection criteria We defined 'implementation' as the use of strategies to adopt and integrate evidence‐based health interventions and to change practice patterns within specific settings. We included any randomised controlled trial (RCT) or cluster‐RCT conducted on any scale, in a school setting, with a parallel control group that compared a strategy to improve the implementation of policies or practices to address diet, physical activity, obesity, tobacco use and/or alcohol use by students (aged 5 to 18 years) to no active implementation strategy (i.e. no intervention, inclusive of usual practice, minimal support) or a different implementation strategy. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Given the large number of outcomes reported, we selected and included the effects of a single outcome measure for each trial for the primary outcome using a decision hierarchy (i.e. continuous over dichotomous, most valid, total score over subscore). Where possible, we calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) to account for variable outcome measures with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted meta‐analyses using a random‐effects model. Where we could not combine data in meta‐analysis, we followed recommended Cochrane methods and reported results in accordance with 'Synthesis without meta‐analysis' (SWiM) guidelines. We conducted assessments of risk of bias and evaluated the certainty of evidence (GRADE approach) using Cochrane procedures. Main results We included an additional 14 trials in this update, bringing the total number of included trials in the review to 39 trials with 83 trial arms and 6489 participants. Of these, the majority were conducted in Australia and the USA (n = 15 each). Nine were RCTs and 30 were cluster‐RCTs. Twelve trials tested strategies to implement healthy eating practices; 17 physical activity, two tobacco, one alcohol, and seven a combination of risk factors. All trials used multiple implementation strategies, the most common being educational materials, educational meetings, and education outreach visits, or academic detailing. Of the 39 included trials, we judged 26 as having high risks of bias, 11 as having some concerns, and two as having low risk of bias across all domains. Pooled analyses found, relative to a control (no active implementation strategy), the use of implementation strategies probably results in a large increase in the implementation of interventions in schools (SMD 0.95, 95% CI 0.71, 1.19; I 2  = 78%; 30 trials, 4912 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). This is equivalent to a 0.76 increase in the implementation of seven physical activity intervention components when the SMD is re‐expressed using an implementation measure from a selected included trial. Subgroup analyses by school type and targeted health behaviour or risk factor did not identify any differential effects, and only one study was included that was implemented at scale. Compared to a control (no active implementation strategy), no unintended consequences or adverse effects of interventions were identified in the 11 trials that reported assessing them (1595 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Nine trials compared costs between groups with and without an implementation strategy and the results of these comparisons were mixed (2136 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A lack of consistent terminology describing implementation strategies was an important limitation of the review. Authors' conclusions We found the use of implementation strategies probably results in large increases in implementation of interventions targeting healthy eating, physical activity, tobacco and/or alcohol use. While the effectiveness of individual implementation strategies could not be determined, such examination will likely be possible in future updates as data from new trials can be synthesised. Such research will further guide efforts to facilitate the translation of evidence into practice in this setting. The review will be maintained as a living systematic review. Plain language summary Improving the implementation of school‐based policies and practices to improve student health Key messages • Schools and their staff are able to better implement interventions to address students' healthy eating, physical activity, obesity, and tobacco or alcohol use, when strategies are used to support them to do so. • More research is required to understand which individual strategies are the best for supporting schools and their staff to implement these interventions. • No unwanted effects of providing implementation support to schools have been identified in the studies to date, and information about their cost is limited. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out how effective strategies were in supporting the implementation of school‐based interventions to address diet, physical activity, obesity, tobacco use and/or alcohol use in students (aged 5 to 18 years). For example, whether education and training of school canteen operators (implementation strategy) can improve the implementation of a healthy canteen policy (intervention) to reduce availability of unhealthy food (implementation outcome) and improve student diet. We also wanted to know if they had any adverse effects and if they were cost‐effective. Other examples of strategies include methods of improving quality, feedback on how the school was doing, prompts and reminders, and educational resources (e.g. manuals). What did we do? We updated a previous search that we had conducted for trials that compared the use of a strategy to support intervention implementation to those that had not, or that had compared two or more different implementation strategies. The trials looked at strategies to support the implementation of interventions in schools that addressed student diet, physical activity, obesity, tobacco use and/or alcohol use. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as trial methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 14 new trials to add to those identified in our previous search, bringing the total number of included trials to 39 with 6489 participants. Most were conducted in Australia and the USA and most examined strategies to implement healthy eating and/or physical activity interventions. We found, compared with a control, that the use of implementation strategies probably results in large improvements in the implementation of healthy eating, diet, physical activity, obesity, tobacco use and/or alcohol use interventions in schools. An increasing number of trials assessed potential adverse effects for schools, staff or students and none identified any adverse effects. A number of trials assessed the economic benefits of the use of intervention implementation support strategies; however, the results were inconclusive. What were the limitations of the evidence? Despite our review showing that the use of implementation strategies probably results in large improvements in programme implementation, the trials used methods likely to introduce errors in their results and were primarily conducted in two countries (Australia and USA). As a result, we are moderately confident that strategies to support implementation improve the implementation of these interventions in schools. How up to date is this evidence?

CD006982.PUB5,"Morag, I; Xiao, Y-T; Bruschettini, M",Cycled light in the intensive care unit for preterm and low birth weight infants,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Background Preterm and low birth weight infants are at an early stage of development, and do not receive adequate maternal circadian signals. They are often cared for over prolonged periods of hospitalisation in neonatal intensive care units (NICU), where environmental circadian stimuli are lacking. Exposure to artificial light–dark cycles may stimulate the development of the circadian system and improve clinical outcomes. However, it remains uncertain whether cycled light (CL) is preferable to near darkness (ND) or continuous bright light (CBL) in fostering development and maturation, and reducing adverse neonatal health outcomes. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane review, last published in 2016. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of CL in preterm and low birth weight infants compared to ND or CBL. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and two trial registries to September 2023. We also checked reference lists, and searched for retractions of included studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs in preterm infants (< 37 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA)), or those with a low birth weight (< 2500 g), admitted and cared for in an NICU or a step‐down unit, comparing CL with ND or CBL. Data collection and analysis We used the standard review methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to assess the methodological quality of studies. We used the fixed‐effect model with risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD), with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data. Our primary outcomes were (1) growth at three and six months' corrected age, (2) major neurodevelopmental disability, and (3) adverse effects. Our secondary outcomes were (4) retinopathy of prematurity, (5) duration of initial hospitalisation, (6) duration of oxygen treatment, and (7) parent satisfaction. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results We included 20 studies with 1633 infants. Data for meta‐analysis were available for 11 studies (1126 infants). One study with multiple arms was included in both comparisons. We rated the overall risk of bias at the study level as high or unclear for all 20 studies that had one or several unclear or high risk of bias judgements across the domains. Cycled light versus dimmed light or near darkness (10 studies) The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cycled light compared to dimmed light (reduction of illumination levels) or near darkness on weight at three months (MD 24.79, 95% CI ‐262.33 to 311.91; 2 studies, 187 infants; very low‐certainty evidence), and weight at six months (MD 202, 95% CI ‐109.68 to 513.68; 1 study, 147 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). The studies did not report any data for major neurodevelopmental disability. No data are available for adverse effects; it is uncertain if the absence of adverse effects is because none occurred, or because they were not identified and recorded. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cycled light compared to dimmed light or near darkness on the likelihood of developing retinopathy of prematurity of any stage (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.03; 3 studies, 307 infants; very low‐certainty evidence), and severe retinopathy of prematurity of stage 3 or higher (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.61; 4 studies, 454 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). Cycled light compared to dimmed light or near darkness may have little to no effect on the duration of initial hospitalisation (MD ‐3.04, 95% CI ‐7.86 to 1.78; 5 studies, 550 infants; very low‐certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Cycled light versus continuous bright light (11 studies) No data are available on the following primary outcomes, as no studies reported them: growth at three and six months' corrected age, major neurodevelopmental disability, and adverse effects. It is uncertain if the absence of adverse effects is because none occurred or because they were not identified and recorded. No data are available on retinopathy of prematurity, as no studies reported it. Cycled light compared to continuous bright light may reduce the duration of initial hospitalisation, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD ‐9.86, 95% CI ‐10.09 to ‐9.63; 5 studies, 499 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Despite identifying 20 studies, we remain uncertain about the effect of CL compared to ND or CBL on all outcomes of interest in this review. In addition, a few critical outcomes were not reported by any of the included studies. The evidence remains uncertain about whether CL is the right choice in the NICU. The physician should always weigh the benefits and risks, based on the effects of the different options in the specific setting. Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of cycled light in the intensive care unit for preterm or very low birth weight infants? Key messages • For babies who are born prematurely, we do not know whether cycled light in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) has an effect on growth, development of the nervous system, and unwanted effects. • We do not know whether cycled light in NICUs reduces the length of hospital stay. • Future research in this area should focus on assessing the effect of cycled light in NICUs on long‐term health. What is cycled light in the intensive care unit? Babies who are born prematurely do not receive enough signals about body systems from their mothers to develop their circadian rhythm, which is the body's internal clock. They are typically cared for in NICUs after birth, where constant bright lighting is often used. Such an environment lacks time‐specific signals, such as light and dark cycles. This may further limit the development of the nervous system. Cycled light refers to a method in which the lighting in the NICU is adjusted, typically mimicking the natural cycles of light and darkness that babies would experience outside the hospital. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of cycled light in the NICU on a baby's growth, nervous system development, length of hospital stay, length of oxygen treatment, and unwanted side effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at cycled light compared with near darkness or continuous bright light in the NICU. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 20 studies that involved 1633 babies who were born prematurely. The studies compared cycled light to near darkness or constant bright light in NICUs, and were conducted in countries around the world. Compared to near darkness, we do not know whether cycled light makes a difference to a baby's growth, development of the nervous system, length of hospital stay, length of oxygen treatment, or unwanted side effects. Compared to constant bright light, we do not know whether cycled light makes a difference to a baby's growth, development of the nervous system, length of oxygen treatment, or unwanted side effects. Cycled light may reduce the length of a hospital stay by 10 days, but we are very uncertain about these results. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are not confident in the evidence, because there are not enough studies with enough babies (sample size), that were conducted well, to be certain about the results. The studies did not all provide data about the outcomes of the review. How up to date is this evidence? This review updates our 2026 review.

CD014762.PUB2,"Sachdeva, A; Rai, BP; Veeratterapillay, R; Harding, C; Nambiar, A",Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs for treating symptomatic uncomplicated urinary tract infections in non‐pregnant adult women,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Background Almost half of all women will have at least one symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime. Although usually self‐remitting, 74% of women contacting a health professional are prescribed an antibiotic, and in rare instances, they may progress to more severe infections. Therefore, the standard of care for the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs is oral antibiotic therapy, which aims to achieve symptom resolution and prevent the development of complications such as pyelonephritis. Given that a number of UTIs are self‐remitting, non‐antibiotic treatments that may help reduce the severity or duration of symptoms or reduce the need for antibiotics may be of benefit. Objectives This review aims to investigate the benefits and risks associated with the use of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs in non‐pregnant adult women. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 18 November 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs looking at the effectiveness of NSAIDs in the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs in non‐pregnant adult women. The outcomes of interest were: 1) short‐term resolution of symptoms (days 1 to 4); 2) medium‐term resolution of symptoms (days 5 to 10); and 3) incidence of adverse events (including progression to sepsis or complicated UTI, hospitalisation or need for intravenous antibiotics, gastrointestinal complications, or death) up to 30 days from randomisation. Data collection and analysis Screening, abstract selection, and data extraction were carried out independently by two authors, and any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main results Six studies (1646 randomised women) published between 2010 and 2019 met our inclusion criteria. The mean age ranged from 28 to 50 years; previous UTIs were reported in 7.2% to 77% of participants. There were five multicentre studies, and studies were carried out in Denmark, Germany, Korea, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. Overall, the risk of bias was low or unclear. Compared to antibiotics, NSAIDs probably result in less short‐term resolution of symptoms (4 studies, 1144 participants: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.91; I 2  = 75%; moderate certainty) and may also result in less medium‐term resolution of symptoms (4 studies, 1140 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; I 2  = 78%; low certainty). NSAIDs probably make little or no difference to the number of adverse events by day 30 (4 studies, 1165 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33; I 2  = 64%; moderate certainty). NSAIDs may result in longer duration of symptoms (2 studies, 553 participants: MD 1.00 day, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.39; I 2  = 0%; low certainty). NSAIDs may result in a lower proportion of women experiencing microbiological resolution by day 10 compared to antibiotics (2 studies, 322 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I 2  = 0%; low certainty) and probably result in more women using rescue antibiotic treatment by day 30 (4 studies, 1165 participants: RR 3.14, 95% CI 2.23 to 4.42; I 2  = 49%; moderate certainty). Compared to placebo, NSAIDs may reduce the use of rescue antibiotic treatment (1 study, 183 participants: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; low certainty evidence) but may make little or no difference to adverse events at day 30. Compared to the herbal product Uva‐Ursi, NSAIDs may make little or no difference to adverse events by day 30. Authors' conclusions The use of NSAIDs for symptomatic management of uncomplicated UTIs probably results in less short‐term resolution of symptoms and greater use of rescue antibiotics by day 30 compared to primary antibiotic treatment. Future studies should consider the various confounders such as degree of symptoms, microbiology, type and resistance patterns of bacteria involved and number of UTI episodes in the months prior to commencement of treatment. Plain language summary Are non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) effective for treating symptomatic uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women? Key messages • Compared to antibiotics (medicines used to treat a wide range of infections or diseases caused by bacteria), NSAIDs (medicines that reduce inflammation, pain and fever) probably result in less short‐term resolution of urinary tract infection symptoms (1 to 4 days), and may result in less medium‐term resolution of symptoms (5 to 10 days). • NSAIDs may result in a longer duration of symptoms and probably result in more women needing antibiotic treatment by day 30. What is an uncomplicated urinary tract infection? The majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women (a condition where bacteria gets into the urine and travels up to the bladder) are uncomplicated (occurring in a healthy person with no urinary tract abnormalities or other medical conditions) and self‐limiting (get better without treatment). The symptoms often experienced are a burning sensation while passing urine, increased urinary frequency, and urgency. How are urinary tract infections treated? When symptoms are bothersome, treatment is often sought, and antibiotics (medicines used to treat a wide range of infections or diseases caused by bacteria) are commonly used. With both patients and doctors becoming more aware of the negative impacts of repeated antibiotic use, more work is being done to evaluate non‐antibiotic treatments for the control of UTI symptoms. Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are medicines that reduce inflammation, pain and fever. It has been suggested that the anti‐inflammatory effect of NSAIDs may alleviate the symptoms of UTIs. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if NSAIDs were better than antibiotics at improving UTI symptoms, reducing their severity and duration, and reducing the reliance on antibiotics. We also wanted to find out if NSAIDs were associated with any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at NSAIDs compared with antibiotics or other interventions in women with uncomplicated UTIs. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We included six studies randomising 1646 women. The mean age ranged from 28 to 50 years, and previous UTIs were reported in 7.2% to 77% of women. Five studies were undertaken in multiple centres, and the studies were carried out in Denmark, Germany, Korea, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. Compared to antibiotics, NSAIDs probably result in less short‐term resolution of symptoms (1 to 4 days) and may also result in less medium‐term resolution of symptoms (5 to 10 days). NSAIDs probably make little or no difference to the number of adverse events by day 30. NSAIDs may result in a longer duration of symptoms and may result in a lower proportion of women experiencing microbiological resolution (no bacteria in the urine) by day 10. NSAIDs probably result in more women needing antibiotic treatment by day 30. Compared to placebo, NSAIDs may reduce the need for antibiotic treatment but may make little or no difference to adverse events by day 30. Compared to a herbal product, NSAIDs may make little or no difference to adverse events. What are the limitations of the evidence? The small number of studies (per comparison) and the small size of the studies were limitations in this review. Not all the studies provided data about the outcomes we were interested in. We are moderately confident that compared to antibiotics, NSAIDs result in less short‐term resolution of UTI symptoms and more women needing antibiotic treatment by day 30. We are less certain about their effect on the duration of symptoms. How up to date is the evidence?

CD011575.PUB3,"Falk, JM; Froentjes, L; Kirkwood, JEM; Heran, BS; Kolber, MR; Allan, GM; Korownyk, CS; Garrison, SR",Higher blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,"Abstract - Background This is an update of the original Cochrane review, published in 2017. Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in adults, 65 years of age or older, attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) of < 160 mmHg. Collectively, these trials demonstrated cardiovascular benefit for treatment, compared to no treatment, for older adults with BP > 160 mmHg. However, an even lower BP target of < 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. Yet the risk and benefit of antihypertensive therapy can be expected to vary across populations, and some observational evidence suggests that older adults who are frail might have better health outcomes with less aggressive BP lowering. Current clinical practice guidelines are inconsistent in target BP recommendations for older adults, with systolic BP targets ranging from < 130 mmHg to < 150 mmHg. The 2017 review did not find compelling evidence of a reduction in any of the primary outcomes, including all‐cause mortality, stroke, or total serious cardiovascular adverse events, comparing a lower BP target to a higher BP target in older adults with hypertension. It is important to update this review to explore if new evidence exists to determine whether older adults might do just as well, better, or worse with less aggressive pharmacotherapy for hypertension. Objectives To assess the effects of a less aggressive blood pressure target (in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg), compared to a conventional or more aggressive BP target (of < 140/90 mmHg or lower) in hypertensive adults, 65 years of age or older. Search methods For this update, Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to June 2024: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid, and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also contacted authors of relevant papers requesting information on further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised trials of hypertensive older adults (≥ 65 years) that spanned at least one year, and reported the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher or lower systolic or diastolic BP treatment target. Higher BP targets ranged from systolic BP < 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP < 95 to 105 mmHg; lower BP targets were 140/90 mmHg or lower, measured in an ambulatory, home, or office setting. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and certainty of the evidence, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and serious cardio‐renal vascular adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non‐cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved. Main results With the addition of one new trial, we included four trials in this updated review (16,732 older adults with a mean age of 70.3 years). Of these, one trial used a combined systolic and diastolic BP target and compared a higher target of < 150/90 mmHg to a lower target of < 140/90 mmHg, and two trials utilised a purely systolic BP target, and compared a systolic BP < 150 mmHg (1 trial) and a systolic BP < 160 mmHg (1 trial), to a systolic BP < 140 mmHg. The fourth and newest trial also utilised a systolic BP target, but also introduced a lower limit for systolic BP. It compared systolic BP in the target range of 130 to 150 mmHg to a lower target range of 110 to 130 mmHg. The evidence shows that treatment to the lower BP target over two to four years may result in little to no difference in all‐cause mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but the lower BP target does reduce stroke (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.67; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; high‐certainty evidence), and likely reduces total serious cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Adverse effects were not available from all trials, but the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 3 studies, 16,008 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions When comparing a higher BP target, in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg, to a lower BP target of 140/90 or lower, over two to four years of follow‐up, there is high‐certainty evidence that the lower BP target reduces stroke, and moderate‐certainty evidence that the lower BP target likely reduces serious cardiovascular events. The effect on all‐cause mortality is unclear (low‐certainty evidence), and the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (moderate‐certainty evidence). Although additional research is warranted in those who are 80 years of age and older, and those who are frail (in whom risks and benefits may differ), conventional BP targets may be appropriate for the majority of older adults. Plain language summary Blood pressure targets for older adults with high blood pressure Key Messages 1. The effect of less aggressive lowering of blood pressure on overall death is unclear. The absolute difference in risks is small, and it is unclear whether these findings would differ for the very elderly, or for those who are frail. 2. For most older adults, relaxing blood pressure targets as one gets older (i.e. letting the blood pressure rise higher than conventional blood pressure targets in younger people) results in an increased risk of stroke, and likely results in an increased risk of serious heart‐related side effects, which includes stroke, heart attack (sudden blockage in blood flow to the heart muscle), heart failure (impairment of the heart's ability to pump blood), kidney impairment, and heart‐related death. 3. Relaxing blood pressure targets does not likely result in fewer people dropping out of blood pressure target trials due to medicine‐related side effects. 4. We need more studies investigating the overall benefits and harms of aiming for lower blood pressure targets in those who are frail, or very elderly. What is high blood pressure? As the pressure of the blood within our arteries rises, it increases the risk of stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney impairment, and death. At some point, as the pressure rises, these risks are high enough to outweigh any potential risks of treatment. This is when people are considered to have 'high blood pressure', or hypertension. How is high blood pressure treated? Weight loss, reducing salt consumption, exercising, and pursuing a Mediterranean diet can all lower blood pressure, but many people also need blood pressure lowering medicine. Current clinical guidelines differ on the best blood pressure target for older adults. The targets range from less than 130/80 to less than 150/90. For people aged 80 years or older, at least one guideline recommends letting blood pressure rise above 160 mmHg before starting treatment. What did we want to find out? Some physicians believe that older adults may be at greater risk of side effects from blood pressure medicine, and we shouldn't try as hard to lower their blood pressure. We wanted to find out if a higher blood pressure target would reduce risk the same and be safer in older adults than the lower blood pressure targets used for the population at large. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared the effect of a higher blood pressure target (less than 150 to 160 mmHg) with a lower blood pressure target (less than 140 mmHg) in people over the age of 65 years. We wanted studies that reported on the number of deaths or other side effects caused by diseases of the heart or the blood vessels, such as heart attack, stroke, or heart failure. We were also interested in other types of health‐related side effects. We only chose randomised studies (where people had the same chance of being put into one of two or more treatment groups) that lasted for at least 12 months. What did we find? For this update, we found one new study. We now have four studies trying to answer this question, and a total of 16,732 older adults. We found there may be little to no difference in the number of overall deaths between those with higher or lower blood pressure targets, who were followed for two to four years. We found that a lower blood pressure target reduces the risk of stroke better than a higher blood pressure target. It probably reduces serious heart‐related events overall (like heart attack, heart failure), and death due to heart problems. A lower BP target probably stops 10 serious cardiovascular events for every 1000 people treated for approximately three years. Aiming for a higher blood pressure target probably makes little to no difference to the portion of people who dropped out of the studies because of side effects related to their medicine. What are the limitations of the evidence? Several factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. 1. People in the studies and their medical providers were aware of which blood pressure target group they were in. This might influence behaviour, or how they report their experience. 2. Not all the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, including side effects. 3. While the evidence focused on older adults, three of the four studies excluded people who were 80 to 85 years of age or older. Therefore, we do not understand the effects of lower blood pressure targets for the very elderly, or for frail populations. How up to date is this evidence?
